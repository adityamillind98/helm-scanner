Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \\\"out\\\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \\\"outlen\\\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \\\"out\\\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated.

Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 8u291, 11.0.11, 16.0.1; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.2 and 21.1.0. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.1 Base Score 7.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).","A user can tell curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly crafted but perfectly legitimate response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.","ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL\\'s own \\\"d2i\\\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \\\"data\\\" and \\\"length\\\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \\\"data\\\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints proc","When curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve data using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server can respond and send back multiple responses at once that curl caches. curl would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached responses but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got *before* the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw, it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses, then pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl into sending data back to the user thinking the attacker\\'s injected data comes from the TLS-protected server."],"filePath":[null,null,null,"/mod-feesfines/templates/deployment.yaml",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"imageVersion":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"latest",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"index":["folio-org/mod-feesfines","deps","CKV_K8S_38","Deployment.default","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_23","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_35","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_14","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","folioci/mod-feesfines:latest","CVE-2021-3711","CVE-2021-22945","CVE-2021-36090","CVE-2021-35517","CVE-2021-35516","CVE-2021-35515","CVE-2021-2388","CVE-2021-22946","CVE-2021-3712","CVE-2021-22947"],"name":["folio-org/mod-feesfines","deps","CKV_K8S_38","Deployment.default","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_23","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_35","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_14","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","folioci/mod-feesfines:latest","CVE-2021-3711","CVE-2021-22945","CVE-2021-36090","CVE-2021-35517","CVE-2021-35516","CVE-2021-35515","CVE-2021-2388","CVE-2021-22946","CVE-2021-3712","CVE-2021-22947"],"nodeType":["root","root","checkov","helmResource","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","image","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE"],"parentNodeResource":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment"],"x":[-0.17363286321754076,0.6921572472390956,-0.20406144146319952,-0.12928632678220642,-0.1454705866244946,-0.2679549994624448,-0.25827497788361153,-0.25241864694832017,-0.25066624856791797,-0.07073015940536743,-0.19546885544258222,-0.04225450434306037,-0.2969202893529433,-0.04257963232884045,-0.12385686589484883,-0.12141489507989076,0.11904131006832828,0.03935690897881269,0.20363503968146132,0.25201513314263296,0.20690997021990004,0.2794232720742594,0.298718971761469,0.11717201370448288,0.23192087996658095,0.1294409871416728,0.00519955881857512],"y":[-0.2033182839203937,1.0,-0.3045024145761209,-0.15433644173843553,-0.32423710500977443,-0.14149212244493625,-0.2773065689795076,-0.09091427142509759,-0.22217023297326088,-0.29475921904431085,-0.07492144869103556,-0.23864546296188838,-0.19253886191436825,-0.17073147046525602,-0.26941328398378755,-0.08268418223720088,0.1274599726191455,0.2786270663540164,0.021438607819310534,0.22708627104496143,0.27968591957398753,0.06437447847159337,0.16298196983363808,0.23837203256818237,0.13196439543526492,0.30968653384196504,0.20029412280330933]},"selected":{"id":"396203"},"selection_policy":{"id":"396202"}},"id":"396143","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{},"id":"396194","type":"NodesOnly"},{"attributes":{"background_fill_color":{"value":"white"},"source":{"id":"396143"},"text":{"field":"name"},"x":{"field":"x"},"y":{"field":"y"}},"id":"396181","type":"LabelSet"},{"attributes":{},"id":"396124","type":"SaveTool"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"396143"}},"id":"396145","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{"bottom_units":"screen","fill_alpha":0.5,"fill_color":"lightgrey","left_units":"screen","level":"overlay","line_alpha":1.0,"line_color":"black","line_dash":[4,4],"line_width":2,"right_units":"screen","syncable":false,"top_units":"screen"},"id":"396127","type":"BoxAnnotation"},{"attributes":{"axis":{"id":"396113"},"ticker":null},"id":"396116","type":"Grid"}],"root_ids":["396102"]},"title":"Bokeh Application","version":"2.3.3"}}
