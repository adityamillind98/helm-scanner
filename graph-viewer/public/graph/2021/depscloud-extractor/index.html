encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \\\"out\\\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \\\"outlen\\\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \\\"out\\\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).","There\\'s a flaw in lz4. An attacker who submits a crafted file to an application linked with lz4 may be able to trigger an integer overflow, leading to calling of memmove() on a negative size argument, causing an out-of-bounds write and/or a crash.

The libX11 XLookupColor request (intended for server-side color lookup) contains a flaw allowing a client to send color-name requests with a name longer than the maximum size allowed by the protocol (and also longer than the maximum packet size for normal-sized packets). The user-controlled data exceeding the maximum size is then interpreted by the server as additional X protocol requests and executed, e.g., to disable X server authorization completely. For example, if the victim encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical session.","A flaw was found in gnutls.

Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., &gt; 32), then drop the connection.","ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL\\'s own \\\"d2i\\\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \\\"data\\\" and \\\"length\\\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \\\"data\\\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints proc","ansi-regex package versions before 6.0.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\\\extraction\\\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \\\"short path\\\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting ","The npm package \\\"tar\\\" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8, and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems.

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.","The npm package \\\"tar\\\" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.","A divide-by-zero flaw was found in ImageMagick 6.9.11-57 and 7.0.10-57 in gem.c. This flaw allows an attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick to trigger undefined behavior through a division by zero. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.","NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.12.0, and NLnet Labs NSD, up to and including version 4.3.3, contain a local vulnerability that would allow for a local symlink attack. When writing the PID file, Unbound and NSD create the file if it is not there, or open an existing file for writing. In case the file was already present, they would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink instead of a regular file. An additional chown of the file would then take place after it was written, making the user Unbound/NSD is supposed to run as the new owner of the file. If an attacker has local access to the user Unbound/NSD runs as, she could create a symlink in place of the PID file pointing to a file that she would like to erase. If then Unbound/NSD is killed and the PID file is not cleared, upon restarting with root privileges, Unbound/NSD will rewrite any file pointed at by the symlink. This is a local vulnerability that could create a Denial of Service of the system Unbound/NSD is running on. It requires an attacker having access to the limited permission user Unbound/NSD runs as and point through the symlink to a critical file on the system.","Due to a missing check for 0 value of `replace_extent`, it is possible for offset `p` to overflow in SubstituteString(), causing potential impact to application availability. This could be triggered by a crafted input file that is processed by ImageMagick. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.","A flaw was found in ImageMagick in coders/hdr.c. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned char`. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to ImageMagick 7.0.8-68.","In `GammaImage()` of /MagickCore/enhance.c, depending on the `gamma` value, it\\'s possible to trigger a divide-by-zero condition when a crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This could lead to an impact to application availability. The patch uses the `PerceptibleReciprocal()` to prevent the divide-by-zero from occurring. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to ImageMagick 7.0.8-68.","In ParseMetaGeometry() of MagickCore/geometry.c, image height and width calculations can lead to divide-by-zero conditions which also lead to undefined behavior. This flaw can be triggered by a crafted input file processed by ImageMagick and could impact application availability. The patch uses multiplication in addition to the function `PerceptibleReciprocal()` in order to prevent such divide-by-zero conditions. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.","A flaw was found in ImageMagick in MagickCore/colorspace-private.h and MagickCore/quantum.h. An attacker who submits a crafted file that is processed by ImageMagick could trigger undefined behavior in the form of values outside the range of type `unsigned char` and math division by zero. This would most likely lead to an impact to application availability, but could potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.","In CatromWeights(), MeshInterpolate(), InterpolatePixelChannel(), InterpolatePixelChannels(), and InterpolatePixelInfo(), which are all functions in /MagickCore/pixel.c, there were multiple unconstrained pixel offset calculations which were being used with the floor() function. These calculations produced undefined behavior in the form of out-of-range and integer overflows, as identified by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. These instances of undefined behavior could be triggered by an attacker who is able to supply a crafted input file to be processed by ImageMagick. These issues could impact application availability or potentially cause other problems related to undefined behavior. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.","WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop with an improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the colormap to have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition will loop 256 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the event logger. The patch replaces the hardcoded 256 value with a call to MagickMin() to ensure the proper value is used. This could impact application availability when a specially crafted input file is processed by ImageMagick. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.","The PALM image coder at coders/palm.c makes an improper call to AcquireQuantumMemory() in routine WritePALMImage() because it needs to be offset by 256. This can cause a out-of-bounds read later on in the routine. The patch adds 256 to bytes_per_row in the call to AcquireQuantumMemory(). This could cause impact to reliability. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.8-68.","A head-based buffer overflow exists in Academy Software Foundation OpenEXR 2.3.0 in writeTileData in ImfTiledOutputFile.cpp that can cause a denial of service via a crafted EXR file.","A Null Pointer Deference issue exists in Academy Software Foundation OpenEXR 2.3.0 in generatePreview in makePreview.cpp that can cause a denial of service via a crafted EXR file.","A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Academy Software Foundation OpenEXR 2.3.0 in chunkOffsetReconstruction in ImfMultiPartInputFile.cpp that can cause a denial of service via a crafted EXR file.","SQLite before 3.32.0 allows a virtual table to be renamed to the name of one of its shadow tables, related to alter.c and build.c.","In ImageMagick 7.0.9, an out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the ReadHEICImageByID function in coders\\\\heic.c.
