Note Superset 0.23 was released prior to any Superset release under the Apache Software Foundation.","While investigating a bug report on Apache Superset, it was determined that an authenticated user could craft requests via a number of templated text fields in the product that would allow arbitrary access to Python\u2019s `os` package in the web application process in versions &lt; 0.37.1. It was thus possible for an authenticated user to list and access files, environment variables, and process information. Additionally it was possible to set environment variables for the current process, create and update files in folders writable by the web process, and execute arbitrary programs accessible by the web process. All other operations available to the `os` package in Python were also available, even if not explicitly enumerated in this CVE.","pillow package versions before 8.3.2 are vulnerable to Out Of Bound(OOB) read. The version fix 6-byte out-of-bounds. The previous bounds check in FliDecode.c incorrectly calculated the required read buffer size when copying a chunk, potentially reading six extra bytes off the end of the allocated buffer from the heap.","In the course of work on the open source project it was discovered that authenticated users running queries against Hive and Presto database engines could access information via a number of templated fields including the contents of query description metadata database, the hashed version of the authenticated users\u2019 password, and access to connection information including the plaintext password for the current connection. It would also be possible to run arbitrary methods on the database connection object for the Presto or Hive connection, allowing the user to bypass security controls internal to Superset. This vulnerability is present in every Apache Superset version &lt; 0.37.2.","sqlparse package versions before 0.4.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). string with severals  \\r\\n in SQL comments cause exponential backtracking which can lead to ReDoS.","The package pillow 5.2.0 and before 8.3.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the getrgb function.","In Apache Thrift 0.9.3 to 0.13.0, malicious RPC clients could send short messages which would result in a large memory allocation, potentially leading to denial of service.","Apache Superset up to and including 1.0.1 allowed for the creation of an external URL that could be malicious. By not checking user input for open redirects the URL shortener functionality would allow for a malicious user to create a short URL for a dashboard that could convince the user to click the link.","There\\'s a flaw in OpenEXR\\'s rleUncompress functionality in versions prior to 3.0.5.
