API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \\\"out\\\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \\\"outlen\\\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \\\"out\\\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).","libfetch before 2021-07-26, as used in apk-tools, xbps, and other products, mishandles numeric strings for the FTP and HTTP protocols. The FTP passive mode implementation allows an out-of-bounds read because strtol is used to parse the relevant numbers into address bytes. It does not check if the line ends prematurely. If it does, the for-loop condition checks for the \\'\\0\\' terminator one byte too late.","When sending data to an MQTT server, libcurl &lt;= 7.73.0 and 7.78.0 could in some circumstances erroneously keep a pointer to an already freed memory area and both use that again in a subsequent call to send data and also free it *again*.","An issue was discovered in ncurses through v6.2-1. _nc_captoinfo in captoinfo.c has a heap-based buffer overflow.","jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations with []string{} for m[\\\"aud\\\"] (which is allowed by the specification). Because the type assertion fails, \\\"\\\" is the value of aud. This is a security problem if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.","A user can tell curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly crafted but perfectly legitimate response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.","libcurl-using applications can ask for a specific client certificate to be used in a transfer. This is done with the `CURLOPT_SSLCERT` option (`--cert` with the command line tool).When libcurl is built to use the macOS native TLS library Secure Transport, an application can ask for the client certificate by name or with a file name - using the same option. If the name exists as a file, it will be used instead of by name.If the appliction runs with a current working directory that is writable by other users (like `/tmp`), a malicious user can create a file name with the same name as the app wants to use by name, and thereby trick the application to use the file based cert instead of the one referred to by name making libcurl send the wrong client certificate in the TLS connection handshake.","ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL\\'s own \\\"d2i\\\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \\\"data\\\" and \\\"length\\\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \\\"data\\\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints proc","When curl is instructed to download content using the metalink feature, thecontents is verified against a hash provided in the metalink XML file.The metalink XML file points out to the client how to get the same contentfrom a set of different URLs, potentially hosted by different servers and theclient can then download the file from one or several of them. In a serial orparallel manner.If one of the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contentsof the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload, curlshould detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a completeddownload. It should remove the contents and instead try getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the potentially malicious content is kept in the file ondisk.","In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd\\'s CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd\\'s CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.","When curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve data using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server can respond and send back multiple responses at once that curl caches. curl would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached responses but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got *before* the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw, it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses, then pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl into sending data back to the user thinking the attacker\\'s injected data comes from the TLS-protected server.","curl supports the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS`in libcurl. This rarely used option is used to send variable=content pairs toTELNET servers.Due to flaw in the option parser for sending `NEW_ENV` variables, libcurlcould be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to theserver. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to theserver using a clear-text network protocol.This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly whenparsing the string provided by the application.","When curl is instructed to get content using the metalink feature, and a user name and password are used to download the metalink XML file, those same credentials are then subsequently passed on to each of the servers from which curl will download or try to download the contents from. Often contrary to the user\\'s expectations and intentions and without telling the user it happened.","containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim\u2019s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \\\"host\\\" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line simila"],"filePath":[null,null,null,"/helm-release-pruner/templates/cronjob.yml",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"imageVersion":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"v3.2.0",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"index":["fairwinds-stable/helm-release-pruner","deps","CKV_K8S_38","CronJob.default","CKV_K8S_29","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","quay.io/fairwinds/helm-release-pruner:v3.2.0","CVE-2021-3711","CVE-2021-36159","CVE-2021-22945","CVE-2021-39537","CVE-2020-26160","CVE-2021-22946","CVE-2021-22926","CVE-2021-3712","CVE-2021-22922","CVE-2021-21334","CVE-2021-22947","CVE-2021-22925","CVE-2021-22923","CVE-2020-15257"],"name":["fairwinds-stable/helm-release-pruner","deps","CKV_K8S_38","CronJob.default","CKV_K8S_29","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","quay.io/fairwinds/helm-release-pruner:v3.2.0","CVE-2021-3711","CVE-2021-36159","CVE-2021-22945","CVE-2021-39537","CVE-2020-26160","CVE-2021-22946","CVE-2021-22926","CVE-2021-3712","CVE-2021-22922","CVE-2021-21334","CVE-2021-22947","CVE-2021-22925","CVE-2021-22923","CVE-2020-15257"],"nodeType":["root","root","checkov","helmResource","checkov","checkov","checkov","image","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE"],"parentNodeResource":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob","CronJob"],"x":[0.17589809245157317,-1.0,0.06504152580217978,0.10879393824943512,0.12393140172696047,0.17793528594955152,0.23806044642305385,0.016627833135269495,-0.12888490500012717,-0.16112966221559008,0.19196032738706192,0.014249688262262692,-0.006700580784803302,-0.1221032244957572,0.04195255196328618,-0.05757655721141599,0.13472781836288503,0.0880246077817135,0.15572461309553992,-0.07273290656912262,0.16513500208371243,-0.14893529639766875],"y":[0.44909708641437174,-0.5050816082368219,0.3871889160916242,0.2276334601760828,0.39244177986760964,0.3448008048847202,0.3561755116421909,-0.07657904464679183,-0.18746314272197775,-0.050124093884518106,-0.0634684615336189,-0.26882739634151326,-0.18402388626368946,0.012535322686299403,0.04584782237682113,0.0560748356655256,-0.001411867943010282,-0.23597418718458563,-0.20523790167384398,-0.24191314150188165,-0.13277866274170413,-0.11891214513128895]},"selected":{"id":"369959"},"selection_policy":{"id":"369958"}},"id":"369899","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"active_multi":null,"tools":[{"id":"369877"},{"id":"369878"},{"id":"369879"},{"id":"369880"},{"id":"369881"},{"id":"369882"},{"id":"369891"},{"id":"369892"},{"id":"369893"}]},"id":"369884","type":"Toolbar"},{"attributes":{},"id":"369902","type":"MultiLine"},{"attributes":{},"id":"369882","type":"HelpTool"},{"attributes":{"formatter":{"id":"369945"},"major_label_policy":{"id":"369943"},"ticker":{"id":"369874"}},"id":"369873","type":"LinearAxis"},{"attributes":{"data_source":{"id":"369903"},"glyph":{"id":"369902"},"hover_glyph":null,"muted_glyph":null,"view":{"id":"369905"}},"id":"369904","type":"GlyphRenderer"},{"attributes":{"callback":null},"id":"369892","type":"TapTool"},{"attributes":{"axis":{"id":"369869"},"ticker":null},"id":"369872","type":"Grid"},{"attributes":{"background_fill_color":{"value":"white"},"source":{"id":"369899"},"text":{"field":"name"},"x":{"field":"x"},"y":{"field":"y"}},"id":"369937","type":"LabelSet"},{"attributes":{},"id":"369961","type":"Selection"},{"attributes":{"axis":{"id":"369873"},"dimension":1,"ticker":null},"id":"369876","type":"Grid"},{"attributes":{"callback":null,"tooltips":[["Name","@name"],["NodeType","@nodeType"],["Description","@description"]]},"id":"369891","type":"HoverTool"},{"attributes":{},"id":"369870","type":"BasicTicker"},{"attributes":{"formatter":{"id":"369942"},"major_label_policy":{"id":"369940"},"ticker":{"id":"369870"}},"id":"369869","type":"LinearAxis"},{"attributes":{"bottom_units":"screen","fill_alpha":0.5,"fill_color":"lightgrey","left_units":"screen","level":"overlay","line_alpha":1.0,"line_color":"black","line_dash":[4,4],"line_width":2,"right_units":"screen","syncable":false,"top_units":"screen"},"id":"369957","type":"BoxAnnotation"}],"root_ids":["369858"]},"title":"Bokeh Application","version":"2.3.3"}}
