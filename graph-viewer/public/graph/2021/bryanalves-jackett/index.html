This leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.","An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.x before 6.9.4_rc2. In the function gb18030_mbc_enc_len in file gb18030.c, a UChar pointer is dereferenced without checking if it passed the end of the matched string. This leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.","Oniguruma before 6.9.3 allows Stack Exhaustion in regcomp.c because of recursion in regparse.c.","GNU Wget through 1.21.1 does not omit the Authorization header upon a redirect to a different origin, a related issue to CVE-2018-1000007.","Arm Armv8-A core implementations utilizing speculative execution past unconditional changes in control flow may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis, aka \\\"straight-line speculation.\\\"","A Reachable Assertion issue was discovered in the KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.17. If an attacker can obtain a krbtgt ticket using an older encryption type (single-DES, triple-DES, or RC4), the attacker can crash the KDC by making an S4U2Self request.","An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the \\'num\\' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the \\'num\\' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support \\\"saved UID\\\" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \\\"enable -f\\\" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a denial of service.","This issue was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.0.1, watchOS 7.0, iOS 14.0 and iPadOS 14.0, iCloud for Windows 7.21, tvOS 14.0. A remote attacker may be able to cause a denial of service.","libpcre in PCRE before 8.43 allows a subject buffer over-read in JIT when UTF is disabled, and \\\\X or \\\\R has more than one fixed quantifier, a related issue to CVE-2019-20454.","Interaction between the sks-keyserver code through 1.2.0 of the SKS keyserver network, and GnuPG through 2.2.16, makes it risky to have a GnuPG keyserver configuration line referring to a host on the SKS keyserver network. Retrieving data from this network may cause a persistent denial of service, because of a Certificate Spamming Attack.","In the client side of Heimdal before 7.6.0, failure to verify anonymous PKINIT PA-PKINIT-KX key exchange permits a man-in-the-middle attack. This issue is in krb5_init_creds_step in lib/krb5/init_creds_pw.c.","An information disclosure issue was addressed with improved state management. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.0.1, watchOS 7.0, iOS 14.0 and iPadOS 14.0, iTunes for Windows 12.10.9, iCloud for Windows 11.5, tvOS 14.0. A remote attacker may be able to leak memory.","An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. The pre-defined function \\\"strlen\\\" is getting a \\\"NULL\\\" string as a parameter value in plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/ldap_principal2.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a modified kadmin client.","chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal\\'s input buffer.","The iconv feature in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.32, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer over-read.","A Bleichenbacher type side-channel based padding oracle attack was found in the way gnutls handles verification of RSA decrypted PKCS#1 v1.5 data. An attacker who is able to run process on the same physical core as the victim process, could use this to extract plaintext or in some cases downgrade any TLS connections to a vulnerable server.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.","An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used \\\"group blacklisting\\\" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.","In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.28, the getaddrinfo function would successfully parse a string that contained an IPv4 address followed by whitespace and arbitrary characters, which could lead applications to incorrectly assume that it had parsed a valid string, without the possibility of embedded HTTP headers or other potentially dangerous substrings."],"filePath":[null,null,null,"/jackett/templates/deployment.yaml",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"imageVersion":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"latest",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"index":["bryanalves/jackett","deps","CKV_K8S_38","Deployment.default","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_29","CKV_K8S_23","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_30","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_14","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","linuxserver/jackett:latest","CVE-2021-23383","CVE-2021-23369","CVE-2019-19919","CVE-2019-20920","GHSA-q42p-pg8m-cqh6","GHSA-q2c6-c6pm-g3gh","GHSA-g9r4-xpmj-mj65","GHSA-2cf5-4w76-r9qv","CVE-2017-18214","CVE-2019-19012","CVE-2019-13224","CVE-2020-9794","CVE-2021-36222","CVE-2019-9513","CVE-2019-9511","CVE-2019-19246","CVE-2019-19204","CVE-2019-19203","CVE-2019-16163","CVE-2021-31879","CVE-2020-13844","CVE-2018-20217","CVE-2020-6096","CVE-2019-18276","CVE-2021-3326","CVE-2020-9991","CVE-2019-20838","CVE-2019-13050","CVE-2019-12098","CVE-2020-9849","CVE-2018-5710","CVE-2016-2781","CVE-2019-25013","CVE-2018-16868","CVE-2020-27618","CVE-2018-7169","CVE-2016-10739"],"name":["bryanalves/jackett","deps","CKV_K8S_38","Deployment.default","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_29","CKV_K8S_23","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_30","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_14","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","linuxserver/jackett:latest","CVE-2021-23383","CVE-2021-23369","CVE-2019-19919","CVE-2019-20920","GHSA-q42p-pg8m-cqh6","GHSA-q2c6-c6pm-g3gh","GHSA-g9r4-xpmj-mj65","GHSA-2cf5-4w76-r9qv","CVE-2017-18214","CVE-2019-19012","CVE-2019-13224","CVE-2020-9794","CVE-2021-36222","CVE-2019-9513","CVE-2019-9511","CVE-2019-19246","CVE-2019-19204","CVE-2019-19203","CVE-2019-16163","CVE-2021-31879","CVE-2020-13844","CVE-2018-20217","CVE-2020-6096","CVE-2019-18276","CVE-2021-3326","CVE-2020-9991","CVE-2019-20838","CVE-2019-13050","CVE-2019-12098","CVE-2020-9849","CVE-2018-5710","CVE-2016-2781","CVE-2019-25013","CVE-2018-16868","CVE-2020-27618","CVE-2018-7169","CVE-2016-10739"],"nodeType":["root","root","checkov","helmResource","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","image","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE"],"parentNodeResource":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment"],"x":[0.27771316470109075,1.0,0.34053443814198503,0.20968811583159064,0.2097812072110662,0.34553092062665886,0.31249349572099455,0.2559481440266207,0.31150782692188733,0.3067271978355512,0.19013491105702446,0.2332794042926342,0.31848852184313553,0.3137791343500477,0.2662403357051807,0.21999260511750815,0.33777795864014004,0.28719213113990244,0.24033541935798483,0.27115070073760045,0.2836926297299995,0.25366502314459805,-0.15341353577856784,-0.28247071376653743,-0.12183707749684237,-0.18954769485968798,-0.2301324979146103,-0.1635673877596744,-0.16258076073004038,-0.24806752825326195,-0.3038503032533785,-0.07681772995854397,-0.09807260664409664,-0.07133007988286952,-0.20549143300777464,-0.3062247300695777,-0.2930721547526867,-0.10214572986365923,-0.18184255419294032,-0.19240073266007476,-0.26096880460617816,-0.2216341378902517,-0.04757818177199431,-0.15470177005034327,-0.04275497656497966,-0.13977271492560492,-0.08118960602400137,-0.22337889394036067,-0.2353638478432804,-0.03901981414193082,-0.06494610815600912,-0.10335262675573105,-0.21562445682596815,-0.2864549332176446,-0.1225176209399799,-0.14378940269628201,-0.26665635083436606,-0.22510802156240886,-0.25949506508220493,-0.26848070145885555],"y":[0.11146622692606849,0.09604957234683785,0.0656857761034038,0.0855571412470942,0
