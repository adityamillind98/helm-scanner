The highest risk of this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.","In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd\\'s CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd\\'s CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.","When curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve data using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server can respond and send back multiple responses at once that curl caches. curl would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached responses but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got *before* the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw, it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses, then pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl into sending data back to the user thinking the attacker\\'s injected data comes from the TLS-protected server.","containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim\u2019s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \\\"host\\\" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line simila","libpcre in PCRE before 8.43 allows a subject buffer over-read in JIT when UTF is disabled, and \\\\X or \\\\R has more than one fixed quantifier, a related issue to CVE-2019-20454.","The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) versions 2.32 and 2.33 has a use-after-free. It may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly unspecified other impact.","libssh 0.9.4 has a NULL pointer dereference in tftpserver.c if ssh_buffer_new returns NULL.","An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.8. When g_file_replace() is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates the target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably have security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the path is a symlink to a file that already exists, then the contents of that file correctly remain unchanged.)","libpcre in PCRE before 8.44 allows an integer overflow via a large number after a "],"filePath":[null,null,null,"/argocd-operator/templates/crd-reader.yaml",null,"/argocd-operator/templates/ClusterRole.yaml",null,"/argocd-operator/templates/wait-for-crd.yaml",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"imageVersion":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"4.7",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"index":["redhat-cop/argocd-operator","deps","CKV_K8S_42","ClusterRoleBinding.default","CKV_K8S_49","ClusterRole.default","CKV_K8S_38","Pod.default","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_29","CKV_K8S_23","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_30","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:4.7","CVE-2021-35942","CVE-2020-12762","CVE-2021-3580","CVE-2021-33560","CVE-2021-22946","CVE-2021-3445","CVE-2021-21334","CVE-2021-22947","CVE-2020-15257","CVE-2019-20838","CVE-2021-33574","CVE-2020-16135","CVE-2021-28153","CVE-2020-14155"],"name":["redhat-cop/argocd-operator","deps","CKV_K8S_42","ClusterRoleBinding.default","CKV_K8S_49","ClusterRole.default","CKV_K8S_38","Pod.default","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_29","CKV_K8S_23","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_30","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","quay.io/openshift/origin-cli:4.7","CVE-2021-35942","CVE-2020-12762","CVE-2021-3580","CVE-2021-33560","CVE-2021-22946","CVE-2021-3445","CVE-2021-21334","CVE-2021-22947","CVE-2020-15257","CVE-2019-20838","CVE-2021-33574","CVE-2020-16135","CVE-2021-28153","CVE-2020-14155"],"nodeType":["root","root","checkov","helmResource","checkov","helmResource","checkov","helmResource","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","image","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE"],"parentNodeResource":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod","Pod"],"x":[-0.027241115356776213,-1.0,-0.050626030150078126,-0.06289276060105017,-0.2208433666547924,-0.3466299683841225,0.0986213631223264,0.003676337565189159,-0.11367262498953472,0.06992438182022193,-0.11410789796521406,0.07829448430603397,-0.08475399565437028,0.009744421099088104,-0.026221080150642954,-0.0684928915406275,-0.07293207128696814,0.02032484918654025,0.04857158627605638,-0.03800240550764017,0.03298348634782488,0.05605672933348903,-0.06573730560028478,-0.10779501344025437,0.09669330998833467,0.10593178371301244,0.16631662565356564,0.24034993629797105,0.2114708099141992,0.07135614580457655,0.027797463005750176,0.19059755613678436,0.021254149142266327,0.2518353348515037,0.20271132990850924,0.002561584729326758,0.11155351912383935,-0.014017223849222504,0.17633590219374212,0.11900266161142725],"y":[0.18155149356746134,0.009877471001531633,0.3755362403109104,0.507691039550562,0.18391039290700845,0.15143260626805977,0.14003853451392356,0.11252631164363047,0.1567183234695366,0.09872386512012873,0.11396953104135575,0.22099217107745284,0.07439794423055354,0.25628344883939663,0.24352835307168094,0.24286278801430036,0.18959907552118316,0.06560114822303084,0.24646534519667232,0.06111840349549658,0.20168297820762662,0.1526478291628931,0.11702818416509948,0.2056662644716342,0.18515589549351394,-0.2376086540716545,-0.37653572862919155,-0.2975312174294354,-0.3467352544105194,-0.35899464846538065,-0.36715878308032834,-0.1764512506903158,-0.23440489627039118,-0.23589945544643734,-0.23398307356003678,-0.32498792590294445,-0.39450268068073424,-0.2782518820164641,-0.2998699314215812,-0.332090256489228]},"selected":{"id":"903599"},"selection_policy":{"id":"903598"}},"id":"903539","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{},"id":"903600","type":"UnionRenderers"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"903539"}},"id":"903541","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{},"id":"903503","type":"DataRange1d"},{"attributes":{},"id":"903518","type":"WheelZoomTool"}],"root_ids":["903498"]},"title":"Bokeh Application","version":"2.3.3"}}
