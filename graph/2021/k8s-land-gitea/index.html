An attacker who submits a crafted file to an application linked with lz4 may be able to trigger an integer overflow, leading to calling of memmove() on a negative size argument, causing an out-of-bounds write and/or a crash. The greatest impact of this flaw is to availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity as well.","Heap buffer overflow in the TFTP protocol handler in cURL 7.19.4 to 7.65.3.","Double-free vulnerability in the FTP-kerberos code in cURL 7.52.0 to 7.65.3.","BZ2_decompress in decompress.c in bzip2 through 1.0.6 has an out-of-bounds write when there are many selectors.","Integer overflow in the decode_digit function in puny_decode.c in Libidn2 before 2.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact.","In shadow before 4.5, the newusers tool could be made to manipulate internal data structures in ways unintended by the authors. Malformed input may lead to crashes (with a buffer overflow or other memory corruption) or other unspecified behaviors. This crosses a privilege boundary in, for example, certain web-hosting environments in which a Control Panel allows an unprivileged user account to create subaccounts.","Perl before 5.30.3 has an integer overflow related to mishandling of a \\\"PL_regkind[OP(n)] == NOTHING\\\" situation. A crafted regular expression could lead to malformed bytecode with a possibility of instruction injection.","Perl before 5.30.3 on 32-bit platforms allows a heap-based buffer overflow because nested regular expression quantifiers have an integer overflow.","A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where several Nettle signature verification functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA &amp; ECDSA) result in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography point (ECC) multiply function being called with out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting in incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to force an invalid signature, causing an assertion failure or possible validation. The highest threat to this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.","stack_protect_prologue in cfgexpand.c and stack_protect_epilogue in function.c in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 4.1 through 8 (under certain circumstances) generate instruction sequences when targeting ARM targets that spill the address of the stack protector guard, which allows an attacker to bypass the protection of -fstack-protector, -fstack-protector-all, -fstack-protector-strong, and -fstack-protector-explicit against stack overflow by controlling what the stack canary is compared against.","A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd before version v245-rc1, where asynchronous Polkit queries are performed while handling dbus messages. A local unprivileged attacker can abuse this flaw to crash systemd services or potentially execute code and elevate their privileges, by sending specially crafted dbus messages.","A heap buffer overflow in the TFTP receiving code allows for DoS or arbitrary code execution in libcurl versions 7.19.4 through 7.64.1.","The Debian shadow package before 1:4.5-1 for Shadow incorrectly lists pts/0 and pts/1 as physical terminals in /etc/securetty. This allows local users to login as password-less users even if they are connected by non-physical means such as SSH (hence bypassing PAM\\'s nullok_secure configuration). This notably affects environments such as virtual machines automatically generated with a default blank root password, allowing all local users to escalate privileges.","A flaw was found in the way nettle\\'s RSA decryption functions handled specially crafted ciphertext. An attacker could use this flaw to provide a manipulated ciphertext leading to application crash and denial of service.","Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately. This, for example, affects use of ElGamal in OpenPGP.","In OpenLDAP through 2.4.57 and 2.5.x through 2.5.1alpha, an assertion failure in slapd can occur in the issuerAndThisUpdateCheck function via a crafted packet, resulting in a denial of service (daemon exit) via a short timestamp. This is related to schema_init.c and checkTime.","Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).","A user can tell curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly crafted but perfectly legitimate response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.","curl 7.41.0 through 7.73.0 is vulnerable to an improper check for certificate revocation due to insufficient verification of the OCSP response.","curl 7.21.0 to and including 7.73.0 is vulnerable to uncontrolled recursion due to a stack overflow issue in FTP wildcard match parsing.","Due to use of a dangling pointer, libcurl 7.29.0 through 7.71.1 can use the wrong connection when sending data.","A flaw was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading in an assertion failure in slapd in the X.509 DN parsing in decode.c ber_next_element, resulting in denial of service.","A flaw was discovered in ldap_X509dn2bv in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to a slapd crash in the X.509 DN parsing in ad_keystring, resulting in denial of service.","An integer underflow was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to a slapd crash in the Certificate List Exact Assertion processing, resulting in denial of service.","A flaw was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to an infinite loop in slapd with the cancel_extop Cancel operation, resulting in denial of service.","A flaw was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to a memch-&gt;bv_len miscalculation and slapd crash in the saslAuthzTo processing, resulting in denial of service.","A flaw was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to a double free and slapd crash in the saslAuthzTo processing, resulting in denial of service.","A flaw was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to an invalid pointer free and slapd crash in the saslAuthzTo processing, resulting in denial of service.","A flaw was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to a slapd crash in the Values Return Filter control handling, resulting in denial of service (double free and out-of-bounds read).","A flaw was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to an assertion failure in slapd in the saslAuthzTo validation, resulting in denial of service.","An integer underflow was discovered in OpenLDAP before 2.4.57 leading to slapd crashes in the Certificate Exact Assertion processing, resulting in denial of service (schema_init.c serialNumberAndIssuerCheck).","An issue was discovered in p11-kit 0.21.1 through 0.23.21. Multiple integer overflows have been discovered in the array allocations in the p11-kit library and the p11-kit list command, where overflow checks are missing before calling realloc or calloc.","MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.17.2 and 1.18.x before 1.18.3 allows unbounded recursion via an ASN.1-encoded Kerberos message because the lib/krb5/asn.1/asn1_encode.c support for BER indefinite lengths lacks a recursion limit.","A flaw was found in OpenLDAP in versions before 2.4.56. This flaw allows an attacker who sends a malicious packet processed by OpenLDAP to force a failed assertion in csnNormalize23(). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.","A flaw was found in OpenLDAP. This flaw allows an attacker who can send a malicious packet to be processed by OpenLDAP\u2019s slapd server, to trigger an assertion failure. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.","A NULL pointer dereference was found in OpenLDAP server and was fixed in openldap 2.4.55, during a request for renaming RDNs. An unauthenticated attacker could remotely crash the slapd process by sending a specially crafted request, causing a Denial of Service.","regcomp.c in Perl before 5.30.3 allows a buffer overflow via a crafted regular expression because of recursive S_study_chunk calls.","In filter.c in slapd in OpenLDAP before 2.4.50, LDAP search filters with nested boolean expressions can result in denial of service (daemon crash).","In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., &gt; 32), then drop the connection.","A vulnerability was found in gnutls versions from 3.5.8 before 3.6.7. A memory corruption (double free) vulnerability in the certificate verification API. Any client or server application that verifies X.509 certificates with GnuTLS 3.5.8 or later is affected.","cyrus-sasl (aka Cyrus SASL) 2.1.27 has an out-of-bounds write leading to unauthenticated remote denial-of-service in OpenLDAP via a malformed LDAP packet. The OpenLDAP crash is ultimately caused by an off-by-one error in _sasl_add_string in common.c in cyrus-sasl.","ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL\\'s own \\\"d2i\\\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \\\"data\\\" and \\\"length\\\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \\\"data\\\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints proc","curl 7.20.0 through 7.70.0 is vulnerable to improper restriction of names for files and other resources that can lead too overwriting a local file when the -J flag is used.","A code execution vulnerability exists in the directory rehashing functionality of E2fsprogs e2fsck 1.45.4. A specially crafted ext4 directory can cause an out-of-bounds write on the stack, resulting in code execution. An attacker can corrupt a partition to trigger this vulnerability.","The Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.18.5 and 1.19.x before 1.19.3 has a NULL pointer dereference in kdc/do_tgs_req.c via a FAST inner body that lacks a server field.","The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).","When curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve data using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server can respond and send back multiple responses at once that curl caches. curl would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached responses but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got *before* the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw, it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses, then pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl into sending data back to the user thinking the attacker\\'s injected data comes from the TLS-protected server.","The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1","APT had several integer overflows and underflows while parsing .deb packages, aka GHSL-2020-168 GHSL-2020-169, in files apt-pkg/contrib/extracttar.cc, apt-pkg/deb/debfile.cc, and apt-pkg/contrib/arfile.cc. This issue affects: apt 1.2.32ubuntu0 versions prior to 1.2.32ubuntu0.2; 1.6.12ubuntu0 versions prior to 1.6.12ubuntu0.2; 2.0.2ubuntu0 versions prior to 2.0.2ubuntu0.2; 2.1.10ubuntu0 versions prior to 2.1.10ubuntu0.1;","basic/unit-name.c in systemd prior to 246.15, 247.8, 248.5, and 249.1 has a Memory Allocation with an Excessive Size Value (involving strdupa and alloca for a pathname controlled by a local attacker) that results in an operating system crash.","Missing input validation in the ar/tar implementations of APT before version 2.1.2 could result in denial of service when processing specially crafted deb files.","curl 7.1.1 to and including 7.75.0 is vulnerable to an \\\"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\\\" by leaking credentials in the HTTP Referer: header. libcurl does not strip off user credentials from the URL when automatically populating the Referer: HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests, and therefore risks leaking sensitive data to the server that is the target of the second HTTP request.","An issue was discovered in p11-kit 0.21.1 through 0.23.21. A heap-based buffer over-read has been discovered in the RPC protocol used by thep11-kit server/remote commands and the client library. When the remote entity supplies a byte array through a serialized PKCS#11 function call, the receiving entity may allow the reading of up to 4 bytes of memory past the heap allocation.","There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).","A Reachable Assertion issue was discovered in the KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.17. If an attacker can obtain a krbtgt ticket using an older encryption type (single-DES, triple-DES, or RC4), the attacker can crash the KDC by making an S4U2Self request.","The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) versions 2.32 and 2.33 has a use-after-free. It may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly unspecified other impact.","In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.29, proceed_next_node in posix/regexec.c has a heap-based buffer over-read via an attempted case-insensitive regular-expression match.","The malloc implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6), from version 2.24 to 2.26 on powerpc, and only in version 2.26 on i386, did not properly handle malloc calls with arguments close to SIZE_MAX and could return a pointer to a heap region that is smaller than requested, eventually leading to heap corruption.","An integer overflow in the implementation of the posix_memalign in memalign functions in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.26 and earlier could cause these functions to return a pointer to a heap area that is too small, potentially leading to heap corruption.","Double free vulnerability in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) allows attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors involving automatic deletion of security contexts on error.","The wordexp function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.33 may crash or read arbitrary memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.","GnuPG version 2.1.12 - 2.2.11 contains a Cross ite Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in dirmngr that can result in Attacker controlled CSRF, Information Disclosure, DoS. This attack appear to be exploitable via Victim must perform a WKD request, e.g. enter an email address in the composer window of Thunderbird/Enigmail. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in after commit 4a4bb874f63741026bd26264c43bb32b1099f060.","An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the \\'num\\' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the \\'num\\' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","LZ4 before 1.9.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in LZ4_write32 (related to LZ4_compress_destSize), affecting applications that call LZ4_compress_fast with a large input. (This issue can also lead to data corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states \\\"only a few specific / uncommon usages of the API are at risk.\\\"","In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read. A crafted SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.","In libssh2 before 1.9.0, kex_method_diffie_hellman_group_exchange_sha256_key_exchange in kex.c has an integer overflow that could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server. This is related to an _libssh2_check_length mistake, and is different from the various issues fixed in 1.8.1, such as CVE-2019-3855.","It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can get new privileges through the execution of SUID binaries, which would allow to create binaries owned by the service transient group with the setgid bit set. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the GID will be recycled.","It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can create a SUID/SGID binary that would be allowed to run as the transient service UID/GID even after the service is terminated.

This occurs even if the fs.protected_symlinks sysctl is turned on.","In glibc 2.26 and earlier there is confusion in the usage of getcwd() by realpath() which can be used to write before the destination buffer leading to a buffer underflow and potential code execution.","runuser in util-linux allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal\\'s input buffer.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a denial of service.","A flaw was found in the way certificate signatures could be forged using collisions found in the SHA-1 algorithm. An attacker could use this weakness to create forged certificate signatures. This issue affects GnuPG versions before 2.2.18.","GnuPG 2.2.4 and 2.2.5 does not enforce a configuration in which key certification requires an offline master Certify key, which results in apparently valid certifications that occurred only with access to a signing subkey.","nghttp2 version &gt;= 1.10.0 and nghttp2 &lt;= v1.31.0 contains an Improper Input Validation CWE-20 vulnerability in ALTSVC frame handling that can result in segmentation fault leading to denial of service. This attack appears to be exploitable via network client. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in &gt;= 1.31.1.","In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.28, parse_reg_exp in posix/regcomp.c misparses alternatives, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) or trigger an incorrect result by attempting a regular-expression match.","A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version 2.32.","An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in glibc before 2.31 when handling signal trampolines on PowerPC. Specifically, the backtrace function did not properly check the array bounds when storing the frame address, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.","An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. The pre-defined function \\\"strlen\\\" is getting a \\\"NULL\\\" string as a parameter value in plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/ldap_principal2.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a modified kadmin client.","chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal\\'s input buffer.","It was discovered that there was a ECDSA timing attack in the libgcrypt20 cryptographic library.
