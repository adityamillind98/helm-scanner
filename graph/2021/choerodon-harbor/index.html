This affects net.ParseIP and net.ParseCIDR.","encoding/xml in Go before 1.15.9 and 1.16.x before 1.16.1 has an infinite loop if a custom TokenReader (for xml.NewTokenDecoder) returns EOF in the middle of an element. This can occur in the Decode, DecodeElement, or Skip method.","Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5 has functions for DNS lookups that do not validate replies from DNS servers, and thus a return value may contain an unsafe injection (e.g., XSS) that does not conform to the RFC1035 format.","The crypto/tls package of Go through 1.16.5 does not properly assert that the type of public key in an X.509 certificate matches the expected type when doing a RSA based key exchange, allowing a malicious TLS server to cause a TLS client to panic.","In Go before 1.14.14 and 1.15.x before 1.15.7, crypto/elliptic/p224.go can generate incorrect outputs, related to an underflow of the lowest limb during the final complete reduction in the P-224 field.","Go before 1.15.15 and 1.16.x before 1.16.7 has a race condition that can lead to a net/http/httputil ReverseProxy panic upon an ErrAbortHandler abort.","net/http in Go before 1.15.12 and 1.16.x before 1.16.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via a large header to ReadRequest or ReadResponse. Server, Transport, and Client can each be affected in some configurations.","The encoding/xml package in Go versions 1.15 and earlier does not correctly preserve the semantics of directives during tokenization round-trips, which allows an attacker to craft inputs that behave in conflicting ways during different stages of processing in affected downstream applications.","In Go before 1.15.13 and 1.16.x before 1.16.5, some configurations of ReverseProxy (from net/http/httputil) result in a situation where an attacker is able to drop arbitrary headers.",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"NGINX before 1.17.7, with certain error_page configurations, allows HTTP request smuggling, as demonstrated by the ability of an attacker to read unauthorized web pages in environments where NGINX is being fronted by a load balancer.",null,null,null,"A flaw was found in postgresql in versions before 13.3, before 12.7, before 11.12, before 10.17 and before 9.6.22.

The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.","A flaw was found in the way Postgresql allowed a user to modify the behavior of a query for other users. An attacker with a user account could use this flaw to execute code with the permissions of superuser in the database. Versions 9.3 through 10 are affected.",null,"Go before 1.14.12 and 1.15.x before 1.15.5 allows Argument Injection.","Go before 1.14.12 and 1.15.x before 1.15.5 allows Code Injection.","Go before 1.14.12 and 1.15.x before 1.15.4 allows Denial of Service.","Go before 1.13.15 and 14.x before 1.14.7 can have an infinite read loop in ReadUvarint and ReadVarint in encoding/binary via invalid inputs.","In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before versions 1.3.10 and 1.4.4, containers launched through containerd\\'s CRI implementation (through Kubernetes, crictl, or any other pod/container client that uses the containerd CRI service) that share the same image may receive incorrect environment variables, including values that are defined for other containers. If the affected containers have different security contexts, this may allow sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. If you are not using containerd\\'s CRI implementation (through one of the mechanisms described above), you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.","Go before 1.14.8 and 1.15.x before 1.15.1 allows XSS because text/html is the default for CGI/FCGI handlers that lack a Content-Type header.","Go before 1.13.13 and 1.14.x before 1.14.5 has a data race in some net/http servers, as demonstrated by the httputil.ReverseProxy Handler, because it reads a request body and writes a response at the same time.","containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9 and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shim\u2019s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It should be noted that containers started with an old version of containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the same network namespace as the shim (typically the \\\"host\\\" network namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets with AppArmor by adding a line simila","In Go before 1.13.13 and 1.14.x before 1.14.5, Certificate.Verify may lack a check on the VerifyOptions.KeyUsages EKU requirements (if VerifyOptions.Roots equals nil and the installation is on Windows).
