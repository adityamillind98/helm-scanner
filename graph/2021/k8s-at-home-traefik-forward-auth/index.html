an archive\\'s header) can cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.","golang.org/x/net before v0.0.0-20210520170846-37e1c6afe023 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via crafted ParseFragment input.","Go before 1.17 does not properly consider extraneous zero characters at the beginning of an IP address octet, which (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses, because of unexpected octal interpretation. This affects net.ParseIP and net.ParseCIDR.","encoding/xml in Go before 1.15.9 and 1.16.x before 1.16.1 has an infinite loop if a custom TokenReader (for xml.NewTokenDecoder) returns EOF in the middle of an element.
