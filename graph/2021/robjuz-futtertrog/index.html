It may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly unspecified other impact.","The wordexp function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.33 may crash or read arbitrary memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.","An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the \\'num\\' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the \\'num\\' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","LZ4 before 1.9.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in LZ4_write32 (related to LZ4_compress_destSize), affecting applications that call LZ4_compress_fast with a large input. (This issue can also lead to data corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states \\\"only a few specific / uncommon usages of the API are at risk.\\\"","In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read. A crafted SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.","In libssh2 before 1.9.0, kex_method_diffie_hellman_group_exchange_sha256_key_exchange in kex.c has an integer overflow that could lead to an out-of-bounds read in the way packets are read from the server. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server. This is related to an _libssh2_check_length mistake, and is different from the various issues fixed in 1.8.1, such as CVE-2019-3855.","It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can get new privileges through the execution of SUID binaries, which would allow to create binaries owned by the service transient group with the setgid bit set. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the GID will be recycled.","It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can create a SUID/SGID binary that would be allowed to run as the transient service UID/GID even after the service is terminated. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the UID/GID will be recycled.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a denial of service.","A user can tell curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly crafted but perfectly legitimate response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.","The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could optimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call, thus reducing the entropy of the random number generator. This occurred because a volatile operation was not specified. For example, within a single execution of a program, the output of every __builtin_darn() call may be the same.","A flaw was found in the way certificate signatures could be forged using collisions found in the SHA-1 algorithm. An attacker could use this weakness to create forged certificate signatures. This issue affects GnuPG versions before 2.2.18.","GNU libidn2 before 2.2.0 fails to perform the roundtrip checks specified in RFC3490 Section 4.2 when converting A-labels to U-labels. This makes it possible in some circumstances for one domain to impersonate another. By creating a malicious domain that matches a target domain except for the inclusion of certain punycoded Unicode characters (that would be discarded when converted first to a Unicode label and then back to an ASCII label), arbitrary domains can be impersonated.","parser.c in libxml2 before 2.9.5 does not prevent infinite recursion in parameter entities.","A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version 2.32.","An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in glibc before 2.31 when handling signal trampolines on PowerPC. Specifically, the backtrace function did not properly check the array bounds when storing the frame address, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.","chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal\\'s input buffer.","It was discovered that there was a ECDSA timing attack in the libgcrypt20 cryptographic library. Version affected: 1.8.4-5, 1.7.6-2+deb9u3, and 1.6.3-2+deb8u4. Versions fixed: 1.8.5-2 and 1.6.3-2+deb8u7.","The ElGamal implementation in Libgcrypt before 1.9.4 allows plaintext recovery because, during interaction between two cryptographic libraries, a certain dangerous combination of the prime defined by the receiver\\'s public key, the generator defined by the receiver\\'s public key, and the sender\\'s ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration attack against OpenPGP.","When curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve data using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server can respond and send back multiple responses at once that curl caches. curl would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached responses but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got *before* the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw, it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses, then pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl into sending data back to the user thinking the attacker\\'s injected data comes from the TLS-protected server.","The iconv feature in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.32, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer over-read.","The iconv program in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.31 and earlier, when invoked with multiple suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.","The GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.32 could overflow an on-stack buffer during range reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a 0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.","libxml2 2.9.4 and earlier, as used in XMLSec 1.2.23 and earlier and other products, does not offer a flag directly indicating that the current document may be read but other files may not be opened, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via a crafted document.","libpcre in PCRE before 8.44 allows an integer overflow via a large number after a ","An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used \\\"group blacklisting\\\" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege
