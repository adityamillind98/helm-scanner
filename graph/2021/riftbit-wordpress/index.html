An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration \\\"require all denied\\\", these requests can succeed.

The proof of concept attack involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2 v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries are large (e.g., &gt; 32), then drop the connection.","Lodash versions prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable to Command Injection via the template function.","Prototype pollution attack when using _.zipObjectDeep in lodash before 4.17.20.","A prototype pollution vulnerability was found in lodash &lt;4.17.11 where the functions merge, mergeWith, and defaultsDeep can be tricked into adding or modifying properties of Object.prototype.","While fuzzing the 2.4.49 httpd, a new null pointer dereference was detected during HTTP/2 request processing, allowing an external source to DoS the server.
