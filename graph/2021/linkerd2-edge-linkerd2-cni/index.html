This, for example, affects use of ElGamal in OpenPGP.","An issue was discovered in GnuTLS before 3.6.15. A server can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in a TLS 1.3 client if a no_renegotiation alert is sent with unexpected timing, and then an invalid second handshake occurs.

(This only affects the 32-bit compiled version). Remote attackers can cause a denial-of-service or information disclosure, or possibly have unspecified other impact, via a crafted regular expression.","A use-after-free in onig_new_deluxe() in regext.c in Oniguruma 6.9.2 allows attackers to potentially cause information disclosure, denial of service, or possibly code execution by providing a crafted regular expression. The attacker provides a pair of a regex pattern and a string, with a multi-byte encoding that gets handled by onig_new_deluxe(). Oniguruma issues often affect Ruby, as well as common optional libraries for PHP and Rust.","The wordexp function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.33 may crash or read arbitrary memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.","An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the \\'num\\' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the \\'num\\' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","LZ4 before 1.9.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in LZ4_write32 (related to LZ4_compress_destSize), affecting applications that call LZ4_compress_fast with a large input. (This issue can also lead to data corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states \\\"only a few specific / uncommon usages of the API are at risk.\\\"","It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can get new privileges through the execution of SUID binaries, which would allow to create binaries owned by the service transient group with the setgid bit set. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the GID will be recycled.","It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can create a SUID/SGID binary that would be allowed to run as the transient service UID/GID even after the service is terminated. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the UID/GID will be recycled.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a denial of service.","Oniguruma through 6.9.3, as used in PHP 7.3.x and other products, has a heap-based buffer over-read in str_lower_case_match in regexec.c.","An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.x before 6.9.4_rc2. In the function fetch_interval_quantifier (formerly known as fetch_range_quantifier) in regparse.c, PFETCH is called without checking PEND. This leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.","An issue was discovered in Oniguruma 6.x before 6.9.4_rc2. In the function gb18030_mbc_enc_len in file gb18030.c, a UChar pointer is dereferenced without checking if it passed the end of the matched string. This leads to a heap-based buffer over-read.","Oniguruma before 6.9.3 allows Stack Exhaustion in regcomp.c because of recursion in regparse.c.","The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could optimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call, thus reducing the entropy of the random number generator. This occurred because a volatile operation was not specified. For example, within a single execution of a program, the output of every __builtin_darn() call may be the same.","A flaw was found in the way certificate signatures could be forged using collisions found in the SHA-1 algorithm. An attacker could use this weakness to create forged certificate signatures. This issue affects GnuPG versions before 2.2.18.","GNU libidn2 before 2.2.0 fails to perform the roundtrip checks specified in RFC3490 Section 4.2 when converting A-labels to U-labels. This makes it possible in some circumstances for one domain to impersonate another. By creating a malicious domain that matches a target domain except for the inclusion of certain punycoded Unicode characters (that would be discarded when converted first to a Unicode label and then back to an ASCII label), arbitrary domains can be impersonated.","A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version 2.32.","An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in glibc before 2.31 when handling signal trampolines on PowerPC. Specifically, the backtrace function did not properly check the array bounds when storing the frame address, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.","A NULL Pointer Dereference in match_at() in regexec.c in Oniguruma 6.9.2 allows attackers to potentially cause denial of service by providing a crafted regular expression. Oniguruma issues often affect Ruby, as well as common optional libraries for PHP and Rust.","chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal\\'s input buffer.","It was discovered that there was a ECDSA timing attack in the libgcrypt20 cryptographic library. Version affected: 1.8.4-5, 1.7.6-2+deb9u3, and 1.6.3-2+deb8u4. Versions fixed: 1.8.5-2 and 1.6.3-2+deb8u7.","The ElGamal implementation in Libgcrypt before 1.9.4 allows plaintext recovery because, during interaction between two cryptographic libraries, a certain dangerous combination of the prime defined by the receiver\\'s public key, the generator defined by the receiver\\'s public key, and the sender\\'s ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration attack against OpenPGP.","The iconv feature in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.32, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer over-read.","The iconv program in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.31 and earlier, when invoked with multiple suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.","The GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.32 could overflow an on-stack buffer during range reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a 0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.","libpcre in PCRE before 8.44 allows an integer overflow via a large number after a ","An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used \\\"group blacklisting\\\" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.","linkerd2-cni"],"filePath":[null,null,null,"/linkerd2-cni/templates/cni-plugin.yaml",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"imageVersion":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"edge-21.10.1",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"index":["linkerd2-edge/linkerd2-cni","deps","CKV_K8S_19","DaemonSet.default","CKV_K8S_38","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_29","CKV_K8S_23","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","cr.l5d.io/linkerd/cni-plugin:edge-21.10.1","CVE-2021-3520","CVE-2021-20232","CVE-2021-20231","CVE-2021-20305","CVE-2018-12886","CVE-2021-3580","CVE-2021-33560","CVE-2020-24659","CVE-2021-33910","CVE-2021-24031","CVE-2021-33574","CVE-2019-19012","CVE-2019-13224","CVE-2021-35942","CVE-2020-6096","CVE-2019-17543","CVE-2019-3844","CVE-2019-3843","CVE-2021-3326","CVE-2019-19246","CVE-2019-19204","CVE-2019-19203","CVE-2019-16163","CVE-2019-15847","CVE-2019-14855","CVE-2019-12290","CVE-2020-1752","CVE-2020-1751","CVE-2019-13225","CVE-2016-2781","CVE-2019-13627","CVE-2021-40528","CVE-2019-25013","CVE-2016-10228","CVE-2020-27618","CVE-2020-10029","CVE-2020-14155","CVE-2018-7169","linkerd2-cni"],"name":["linkerd2-edge/linkerd2-cni","deps","CKV_K8S_19","DaemonSet.default","CKV_K8S_38","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_29","CKV_K8S_23","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","cr.l5d.io/linkerd/cni-plugin:edge-21.10.1","CVE-2021-3520","CVE-2021-20232","CVE-2021-20231","CVE-2021-20305","CVE-2018-12886","CVE-2021-3580","CVE-2021-33560","CVE-2020-24659","CVE-2021-33910","CVE-2021-24031","CVE-2021-33574","CVE-2019-19012","CVE-2019-13224","CVE-2021-35942","CVE-2020-6096","CVE-2019-17543","CVE-2019-3844","CVE-2019-3843","CVE-2021-3326","CVE-2019-19246","CVE-2019-19204","CVE-2019-19203","CVE-2019-16163","CVE-2019-15847","CVE-2019-14855","CVE-2019-12290","CVE-2020-1752","CVE-2020-1751","CVE-2019-13225","CVE-2016-2781","CVE-2019-13627","CVE-2021-40528","CVE-2019-25013","CVE-2016-10228","CVE-2020-27618","CVE-2020-10029","CVE-2020-14155","CVE-2018-7169","linkerd2-cni"],"nodeType":["root","root","checkov","helmResource","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","image","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","chart"],"parentNodeResource":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet","DaemonSet",null],"x":[0.03817188918377662,0.9636816771192395,0.0225596343353027,0.020524675937693523,-0.03870746612159588,0.09299920576671095,0.06665728637745835,-0.048570922499200045,-0.0024399657883213484,0.0613879233678114,0.09850287184222012,0.11015244207220622,-0.023391271855762983,0.0030499673797084533,-0.0439535590197781,0.07733256465414202,0.12233792069252462,0.04337682578825532,-0.01187213644434787,0.10215935500987468,-0.062015834054651164,-0.1774005224651865,-0.20379387750818992,-0.0037736447505179968,-0.02207033167638816,-0.12510555477089172,-0.04655171825442751,0.03633043840840674,0.06267006180861438,-0.10158759140827646,-0.18928812882790175,-0.13881993914530175,-0.20570752924159239,-0.2025227604276084,0.06748762076234817,-0.1562446197711449,-0.06081240478671371,-0.11001472195246428,-0.09667505936595507,-0.08804581237408948,-0.16991973849867326,-0.03531517789778995,-0.12176483946357047,-0.14517661297129053,-0.17229659547201748,-0.13940383777632953,0.05073985938869662,0.08051254959896521,-0.011386162637308496,0.014979820905578398,0.021371159307986425,-0.07360098842024061,-0.022007191836132124,0.06220728856173359,0.01554909251281781,-0.07670093524415873,0.0033389327426806676,0.0438828493941922,-0.1550264601911255,0.9999999999999999],"y":[0.32410814586208025,-0.2904668479803007
