Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \\\"out\\\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \\\"outlen\\\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \\\"out\\\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).","libfetch before 2021-07-26, as used in apk-tools, xbps, and other products, mishandles numeric strings for the FTP and HTTP protocols. The FTP passive mode implementation allows an out-of-bounds read because strtol is used to parse the relevant numbers into address bytes. It does not check if the line ends prematurely. If it does, the for-loop condition checks for the \\'\\0\\' terminator one byte too late.","An issue was discovered in ncurses through v6.2-1. _nc_captoinfo in captoinfo.c has a heap-based buffer overflow.","ec_verify in kdc/kdc_preauth_ec.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.18.4 and 1.19.x before 1.19.2 allows remote attackers to cause a NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash. This occurs because a return value is not properly managed in a certain situation.","An issue was discovered in urllib3 before 1.26.5. When provided with a URL containing many @ characters in the authority component, the authority regular expression exhibits catastrophic backtracking, causing a denial of service if a URL were passed as a parameter or redirected to via an HTTP redirect.","In Alpine Linux apk-tools before 2.12.5, the tarball parser allows a buffer overflow and crash.","decompress_gunzip.c in BusyBox through 1.32.1 mishandles the error bit on the huft_build result pointer, with a resultant invalid free or segmentation fault, via malformed gzip data.","ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL\\'s own \\\"d2i\\\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \\\"data\\\" and \\\"length\\\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \\\"data\\\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints proc","The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \\\"purpose\\\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \\\"purpose\\\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these v","An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).","grafana-dashboards"],"filePath":[null,null,null,"/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"/grafana/templates/podsecuritypolicy.yaml",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"imageVersion":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"1.10.7",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"index":["dysnix/grafana-dashboards","deps","CKV_K8S_38","Deployment.default","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_30","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","CKV_K8S_35","CKV_K8S_6","PodSecurityPolicy.default","quay.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar:1.10.7","CVE-2021-3711","CVE-2021-36159","CVE-2021-39537","CVE-2021-36222","CVE-2021-33503","CVE-2021-30139","CVE-2021-28831","CVE-2021-3712","CVE-2021-3450","CVE-2021-3449","grafana-dashboards"],"name":["dysnix/grafana-dashboards","deps","CKV_K8S_38","Deployment.default","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_30","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","CKV_K8S_35","CKV_K8S_6","PodSecurityPolicy.default","quay.io/kiwigrid/k8s-sidecar:1.10.7","CVE-2021-3711","CVE-2021-36159","CVE-2021-39537","CVE-2021-36222","CVE-2021-33503","CVE-2021-30139","CVE-2021-28831","CVE-2021-3712","CVE-2021-3450","CVE-2021-3449","grafana-dashboards"],"nodeType":["root","root","checkov","helmResource","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","helmResource","image","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","chart"],"parentNodeResource":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment",null],"x":[-0.03426270043680356,0.308198496137004,0.10726669021328945,-0.012522379093829075,-0.14261218937803233,0.07287450880274195,-0.03949278838699591,0.04794577741292457,-0.10565557796024241,-0.12989078464835252,-0.08791261741040994,0.06300705020005953,-0.09313007384032863,0.10710054680893642,0.07205677982795226,-0.010333155399817577,0.02617383656765895,-0.0591545186364074,0.007268105454935278,-0.1388772154570722,-0.2323896931204018,-0.37222561893033296,0.026639411877689145,0.047924562627315925,-0.10195885101045044,-0.045073858234209806,0.14973220781320257,0.17671645767552074,0.12193813141353184,-0.10146165232678812,0.036618059479935336,0.11745289660500242,-0.02745638166572219,0.24549653701849655],"y":[0.11134657221147347,1.0,0.128111240643212,0.053427246030877326,0.11952750152822164,0.02410236638739566,-0.020044421477673834,0.2015779097459205,0.180633570997775,0.023718058808566395,0.003439498024859006,0.09593353321400003,0.12934313435588501,0.06669645038565297,0.1613689726782268,0.21793154077028648,-0.009086417769717007,0.20316186392985966,0.16789989028574084,0.06932393427512522,0.21183161520529892,0.26221753233655626,-0.31378455906458114,-0.48072303404315636,-0.3392220807781113,-0.40332880776476154,-0.3045585669983258,-0.3689386223047497,-0.39438479422542555,-0.41863374635722417,-0.41712526909184316,-0.454755443811138,-0.47359313992868485,0.9665864718004585]},"selected":{"id":"340475"},"selection_policy":{"id":"340474"}},"id":"340415","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"formatter":{"id":"340461"},"major_label_policy":{"id":"340459"},"ticker":{"id":"340390"}},"id":"340389","type":"LinearAxis"}],"root_ids":["340374"]},"title":"Bokeh Application","version":"2.3.3"}}
