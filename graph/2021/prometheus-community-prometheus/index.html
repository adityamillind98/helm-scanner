If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image which have different environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.10 and containerd 1.4.4. Users should update to these versions.","prometheus"],"filePath":[null,null,null,"/kube-state-metrics/templates/deployment.yaml",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"/prometheus/templates/node-exporter/daemonset.yaml",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"imageVersion":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"v1.1.2",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"v0.21.0",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"v2.26.0",null,null],"index":["prometheus-community/prometheus","deps","CKV_K8S_38","Deployment.default","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_30","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","CKV_K8S_19","DaemonSet.default","CKV_K8S_17","CKV_K8S_26","quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:v1.1.2","CVE-2021-33198","CVE-2021-33196","CVE-2021-33194","CVE-2021-29923","CVE-2021-28831","CVE-2021-27918","CVE-2021-33195","CVE-2021-34558","CVE-2021-36221","CVE-2021-31525","CVE-2021-33197","quay.io/prometheus/alertmanager:v0.21.0","CVE-2018-1000500","CVE-2020-28367","CVE-2020-28366","CVE-2020-28362","CVE-2020-16845","CVE-2021-3114","CVE-2020-24553","CVE-2020-15586","CVE-2020-29510","CVE-2020-14039","quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.26.0","CVE-2021-21334","prometheus"],"name":["prometheus-community/prometheus","deps","CKV_K8S_38","Deployment.default","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_30","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","CKV_K8S_8","CKV_K8S_9","CKV_K8S_19","DaemonSet.default","CKV_K8S_17","CKV_K8S_26","quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:v1.1.2","CVE-2021-33198","CVE-2021-33196","CVE-2021-33194","CVE-2021-29923","CVE-2021-28831","CVE-2021-27918","CVE-2021-33195","CVE-2021-34558","CVE-2021-36221","CVE-2021-31525","CVE-2021-33197","quay.io/prometheus/alertmanager:v0.21.0","CVE-2018-1000500","CVE-2020-28367","CVE-2020-28366","CVE-2020-28362","CVE-2020-16845","CVE-2021-3114","CVE-2020-24553","CVE-2020-15586","CVE-2020-29510","CVE-2020-14039","quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v2.26.0","CVE-2021-21334","prometheus"],"nodeType":["root","root","checkov","helmResource","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","helmResource","checkov","checkov","image","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","image","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","image","CVE","chart"],"parentNodeResource":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment",null,"Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment",null,"Deployment",null],"x":[0.22860897329203242,-0.019480046598619467,0.18582645219244467,0.12909125023641857,0.2214967491355296,0.26781646089770916,0.1857971140753872,0.15030910946933151,0.15346269713257998,0.1243479114043381,0.2629668665027944,0.28507099647876155,0.1913815838497322,0.21873090069180132,0.2601270546628718,0.2234695036962848,0.16811166693487128,0.24304891297101325,0.33362796564849206,0.19470997364333778,0.28998856285685887,0.2725606163339017,-0.03862959315240088,-0.10083755221831293,-0.12269551890911923,-0.1032280167908268,-0.0794760602437143,-0.001610899631156337,-0.09497919611886758,-0.14589541335807985,-0.14779407887332519,-0.11154127679782225,-0.13916545590957716,-0.11706944521175407,-0.19099483154633476,-0.20640142650931967,-0.23799426654633407,-0.33204765147783644,-0.3163347388677582,-0.2849322196209752,-0.3213457510722462,-0.2991908060507725,-0.3563217990058021,-0.28275460778743644,-0.34149051542335923,-0.05369012731115989,-0.07056709917763225,-0.0740829278959491],"y":[0.12052984619835612,-1.0,0.2056176008210908,0.08750162960065676,0.022221270607515133,0.13967286660684475,0.02242412697167743,0.1943298480095879,0.15898071747402626,0.14604115230287226,0.09999701053094084,0.07803362437437372,0.16533518864370936,0.1937867014017956,0.04770005767276082,0.059996025548410686,0.055987739418472876,0.17031467956518792,0.14891928624076164,0.10593765551989225,0.21282245821365606,0.0026947900791517592,-0.0075808540221722,-0.05514694588695568,-0.08951880288575896,-0.009999366389179514,0.05137504188576651,-0.11468646200482094,-0.09996176969336545,-0.06946816453191351,-0.036902159276606956,0.030199706567303336,0.007274927059226251,0.06178693636245026,0.007446895773708776,-0.1445460206680076,0.13963324523533005,-0.03524622689057506,0.026024827213179093,0.13135296739665314,-0.07594246429080524,0.08773910279751243,0.005216917406776621,-0
