SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \\\"out\\\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \\\"outlen\\\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \\\"out\\\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).","musl libc through 1.1.23 has an x87 floating-point stack adjustment imbalance, related to the math/i386/ directory. In some cases, use of this library could introduce out-of-bounds writes that are not present in an application\\'s source code.","In Alpine Linux apk-tools before 2.12.5, the tarball parser allows a buffer overflow and crash.","Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).","Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the \\\"signature_algorithms_cert\\\" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to 1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g (Affected 1.1.1d-1.1.1f).","ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL\\'s own \\\"d2i\\\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \\\"data\\\" and \\\"length\\\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \\\"data\\\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints proc","The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a \\\"purpose\\\" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named \\\"purpose\\\" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines, but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these v","An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2 renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension (where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled (which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).","The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).","The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1","In musl libc through 1.2.1, wcsnrtombs mishandles particular combinations of destination buffer size and source character limit, as demonstrated by an invalid write access (buffer overflow).","There is an overflow bug in the x64_64 Montgomery squaring procedure used in exponentiation with 512-bit moduli. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against 2-prime RSA1024, 3-prime RSA1536, and DSA1024 as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH512 are considered just feasible. However, for an attack the target would have to re-use the DH512 private key, which is not recommended anyway. Also applications directly using the low level API BN_mod_exp may be affected if they use BN_FLG_CONSTTIME. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1e (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1d). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2u (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2t).","OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case. A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK then this problem does not occur at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c)."],"filePath":[null,null,null,"/kubernetes-tagger/templates/deployment.yaml",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"imageVersion":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"1.2.0",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"index":["oxyno-zeta/kubernetes-tagger","deps","CKV_K8S_38","Deployment.default","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_30","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","oxynozeta/kubernetes-tagger:1.2.0","CVE-2021-3711","CVE-2019-14697","CVE-2021-30139","CVE-2021-23840","CVE-2020-1967","CVE-2021-3712","CVE-2021-3450","CVE-2021-3449","CVE-2021-23841","CVE-2020-1971","CVE-2020-28928","CVE-2019-1551","CVE-2019-1549"],"name":["oxyno-zeta/kubernetes-tagger","deps","CKV_K8S_38","Deployment.default","CKV_K8S_40","CKV_K8S_31","CKV_K8S_43","CKV_K8S_30","CKV_K8S_22","CKV_K8S_28","CKV_K8S_20","CKV_K8S_12","CKV_K8S_37","CKV_K8S_15","CKV_K8S_10","CKV_K8S_11","CKV_K8S_13","oxynozeta/kubernetes-tagger:1.2.0","CVE-2021-3711","CVE-2019-14697","CVE-2021-30139","CVE-2021-23840","CVE-2020-1967","CVE-2021-3712","CVE-2021-3450","CVE-2021-3449","CVE-2021-23841","CVE-2020-1971","CVE-2020-28928","CVE-2019-1551","CVE-2019-1549"],"nodeType":["root","root","checkov","helmResource","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","checkov","image","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE"],"parentNodeResource":[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment","Deployment"],"x":[0.22229414025359323,-0.304674451859272,0.15422142415825985,0.16182243482568892,0.10804892541485553,0.28884799025921604,0.2936451271456358,0.12352649047556412,0.31866746598579687,0.23945293984635285,0.2571610449221249,0.20282291639011962,0.22101347675476765,0.20094122438594575,0.28438227776479086,0.15576187127583763,0.29626267185051036,-0.17274750725186375,-0.23068296972583102,-0.2580008809802182,-0.2634482551790301,-0.33475711181058954,-0.2989346437997064,-0.1756178606429837,-0.1635801027070704,-0.2667867597072266,-0.11865996947455203,-0.21072315440219377,-0.30463560156881475,-0.32853698280178534,-0.0970861697979218],"y":[-0.04676595708362938,-1.0,-0.14179006628999907,-0.024031775580605836,-0.04600949975312466,0.0072732747579632995,-0.1079155410705046,-0.10457564363308681,-0.02534508046666205,0.050281988979075876,-0.14393783492708115,0.07593858672029868,-0.10653808029030197,-0.15496065285585744,0.051744316542653955,0.04469154069045175,-0.06348236948054528,0.10219547523673393,-0.03007409208201027,0.045220012913681745,0.24009670348541304,0.13081423717918744,0.0004104966839684531,0.25896142741028305,-0.005044954400876958,0.13656445277312623,0.2268732176030781,0.21033543045039893,0.19014444317193427,0.06707348077225861,0.16185246254377855]},"selected":{"id":"819359"},"selection_policy":{"id":"819358"}},"id":"819299","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"background_fill_color":{"value":"white"},"source":{"id":"819299"},"text":{"field":"name"},"x":{"field":"x"},"y":{"field":"y"}},"id":"819337","type":"LabelSet"},{"attributes":{},"id":"819342","type":"BasicTickFormatter"},{"attributes":{"callback":null,"tooltips":[["Name","@name"],["NodeType","@nodeType"],["Description","@description"]]},"id":"819291","type":"HoverTool"},{"attributes":{},"id":"819274","type":"BasicTicker"},{"attributes":{},"id":"819360","type":"UnionRenderers"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"819303"}},"id":"819305","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{},"id":"819278","type":"WheelZoomTool"},{"attributes":{},"id":"819359","type":"Selection"},{"attributes":{"below":[{"id":"819269"}],"center":[{"id":"819272"},{"id":"819276"}],"height":768,"left":[{"id":"819273"}],"renderers":[{"id":"819297"},{"id":"819337"}],"title":{"id":"819259"},"toolbar":{"id":"819284"},"width":1024,"x_range":{"id":"819261"},"x_scale":{"id":"819265"},"y_range":{"id":"819263"},"y_scale":{"id":"819267"}},"id":"819258","subtype":"Figure","type":"Plot"},{"attributes":{},"id":"819280","type":"SaveTool"},{"attributes":{},"id":"819270","type":"BasicTicker"},{"attributes":{"formatter":{"id":"819345"},"major_label_policy":{"id":"819343"},"ticker":{"id":"819274"}},"id":"819273","type":"LinearAxis"},{"attributes":{},"id":"819281","type":"ResetTool"},{"attributes":{"axis":{"id":"819269"},"ticker":null},"id":"819272","type":"Grid"}],"root_ids":["819258"]},"title":"Bokeh Application","version":"2.3.3"}}
