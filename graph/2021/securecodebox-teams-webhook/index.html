Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \\\"out\\\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \\\"outlen\\\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \\\"out\\\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated.

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL\\'s own \\\"d2i\\\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \\\"data\\\" and \\\"length\\\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \\\"data\\\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur.

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\\\extraction\\\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \\\"short path\\\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with a different string that resolves to the same file system entity, followed by a file using the first form.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\\\\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\\\\` is a valid filename character on posix systems.

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.

Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache.

6.1.2."],"imageVersion":[null,null,"2.9.1",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"index":["securecodebox/teams-webhook","deps","docker.io/securecodebox/teams-webhook:2.9.1","ScanCompletionHook.default","CVE-2021-3711","CVE-2021-36159","CVE-2021-22940","CVE-2021-3712","PRISMA-2021-0125","CVE-2021-37713","CVE-2021-37712","CVE-2021-37701","CVE-2021-3749","CVE-2021-33502","CVE-2021-32804","CVE-2021-32803"],"name":["securecodebox/teams-webhook","deps","docker.io/securecodebox/teams-webhook:2.9.1","ScanCompletionHook.default","CVE-2021-3711","CVE-2021-36159","CVE-2021-22940","CVE-2021-3712","PRISMA-2021-0125","CVE-2021-37713","CVE-2021-37712","CVE-2021-37701","CVE-2021-3749","CVE-2021-33502","CVE-2021-32804","CVE-2021-32803"],"nodeType":["root","root","image",null,"CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE","CVE"],"parentNodeResource":[null,null,null,null,"ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook","ScanCompletionHook"],"x":[0.19277190045859474,-0.7631460786924663,0.03942953952362215,0.12422657704945561,-0.06831728292143452,0.008732047551602597,0.20985351322290097,0.16158397449350306,-0.03891260285392914,0.12470565007346866,0.1996887834202684,0.09567924508425345,-0.1310764022659583,-0.09396065146198339,0.0409592526645825,-0.10221746534648082],"y":[1.0,0.5942828172728322,-0.11162605029199019,0.039135987030679886,-0.24392041387475072,-0.2689914488322135,-0.09198508691289022,-0.03036240863973237,0.03290905953255257,-0.20711576249817565,-0.1813180189115429,-0.28111250502780294,-0.09853042598843917,-0.026052481147718395,0.046734634116241645,-0.17204789582705052]},"selected":{"id":"965807"},"selection_policy":{"id":"965806"}},"id":"965747","type":"ColumnDataSource"},{"attributes":{"graph_layout":{"CVE-2021-22940":[0.20985351322290097,-0.09198508691289022],"CVE-2021-32803":[-0.10221746534648082,-0.17204789582705052],"CVE-2021-32804":[0.0409592526645825,0.046734634116241645],"CVE-2021-33502":[-0.09396065146198339,-0.026052481147718395],"CVE-2021-36159":[0.008732047551602597,-0.2689914488322135],"CVE-2021-3711":[-0.06831728292143452,-0.24392041387475072],"CVE-2021-3712":[0.16158397449350306,-0.03036240863973237],"CVE-2021-3749":[-0.1310764022659583,-0.09853042598843917],"CVE-2021-37701":[0.09567924508425345,-0.28111250502780294],"CVE-2021-37712":[0.1996887834202684,-0.1813180189115429],"CVE-2021-37713":[0.12470565007346866,-0.20711576249817565],"PRISMA-2021-0125":[-0.03891260285392914,0.03290905953255257],"ScanCompletionHook.default":[0.12422657704945561,0.039135987030679886],"deps":[-0.7631460786924663,0.5942828172728322],"docker.io/securecodebox/teams-webhook:2.9.1":[0.03942953952362215,-0.11162605029199019],"securecodebox/teams-webhook":[0.19277190045859474,1.0]}},"id":"965754","type":"StaticLayoutProvider"},{"attributes":{},"id":"965798","type":"NodesOnly"},{"attributes":{},"id":"965711","type":"DataRange1d"},{"attributes":{"active_multi":null,"tools":[{"id":"965725"},{"id":"965726"},{"id":"965727"},{"id":"965728"},{"id":"965729"},{"id":"965730"},{"id":"965739"},{"id":"965740"},{"id":"965741"}]},"id":"965732","type":"Toolbar"},{"attributes":{},"id":"965722","type":"BasicTicker"},{"attributes":{"source":{"id":"965747"}},"id":"965749","type":"CDSView"},{"attributes":{"axis":{"id":"965717"},"ticker":null},"id":"965720","type":"Grid"},{"attributes":{"overlay":{"id":"965731"}},"id":"965727","type":"BoxZoomTool"},{"attributes":{},"id":"965725","type":"PanTool"},{"attributes":{"axis":{"id":"965721"},"dimension":1,"ticker":null},"id":"965724","type":"Grid"},{"attributes":{},"id":"965790","type":"BasicTickFormatter"},{"attributes":{"callback":null},"id":"965740","type":"TapTool"},{"attributes":{"factors":["root","checkov","chart","helmResource","CVE","image"],"palette":["#3288bd","#66c2a5","#abdda4","#e6f598","#fee08b","#fdae61","#f46d43","#d53e4f"]},"id":"965775","type":"CategoricalColorMapper"},{"attributes":{},"id":"965808","type":"UnionRenderers"},{"attributes":{},"id":"965806","type":"UnionRenderers"},{"attributes":{"formatter":{"id":"965790"},"major_label_policy":{"id":"965788"},"ticker":{"id":"965718"}},"id":"965717","type":"LinearAxis"},{"attributes":{"background_fill_color":{"value":"white"},"source":{"id":"965747"},"text":{"field":"name"},"x":{"field":"x"},"y":{"field":"y"}},"id":"965785","type":"LabelSet"},{"attributes":{},"id":"965791","type":"AllLabels"},{"attributes":{"callback":null,"tooltips":[["Name","@name"],["NodeType","@nodeType"],["Description","@description"]]},"id":"965739","type":"HoverTool"},{"attributes":{"below":[{"id":"965717"}],"center":[{"id":"965720"},{"id":"965724"}],"height":768,"left":[{"id":"965721"}],"renderers":[{"id":"965745"},{"id":"965785"}],"title":{"id":"965707"},"toolbar":{"id":"965732"},"width":1024,"x_range":{"id":"965709"},"x_scale":{"id":"965713"},
