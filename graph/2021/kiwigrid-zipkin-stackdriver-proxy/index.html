Typical use of Mercurial prevents construction of such repositories, but they can be created programmatically.","Mercurial prior to 4.3 did not adequately sanitize hostnames passed to ssh, leading to possible shell-injection attacks.","Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted GIF file that triggers memory corruption during display of the splash screen, possibly related to splashscreen.dll.","Integer overflow in the JAR unpacking utility (unpack200) in the unpack library (unpack.dll) in Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier, and JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 16 and earlier, allows untrusted applications and applets to gain privileges via a Pack200 compressed JAR file that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.","Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Management Extensions (JMX) management agent in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update 6 and earlier and JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 15 and earlier, when local monitoring is enabled, allows remote attackers to \\\"perform unauthorized operations\\\" via unspecified vectors.","The Java XML Digital Signature implementation in Sun JDK and JRE 6 before Update 2 does not properly process XSLT stylesheets in XSLT transforms in XML signatures, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted stylesheet, a related issue to CVE-2007-3715.","cext/manifest.c in Mercurial before 4.7.2 has an out-of-bounds read during parsing of a malformed manifest entry.","Mercurial version 4.5 and earlier contains a Incorrect Access Control (CWE-285) vulnerability in Protocol server that can result in Unauthorized data access. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 4.5.1.","In Mercurial before 4.1.3, \\\"hg serve --stdio\\\" allows remote authenticated users to launch the Python debugger, and consequently execute arbitrary code, by using --debugger as a repository name.","The binary delta decoder in Mercurial before 3.7.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a (1) clone, (2) push, or (3) pull command, related to (a) a list sizing rounding error and (b) short records.","The convert extension in Mercurial before 3.8 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted git repository name.","Mercurial before 3.7.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted name when converting a Git repository.","Mercurial before 3.7.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted git ext:: URL when cloning a subrepository.","Unspecified vulnerability in the JAX-WS client and service in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update 6 and earlier allows remote attackers to access URLs or cause a denial of service via unknown vectors involving \\\"processing of XML data\\\" by a trusted application.","jsoup is a Java library for working with HTML. Those using jsoup versions prior to 1.14.2 to parse untrusted HTML or XML may be vulnerable to DOS attacks. If the parser is run on user supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to get stuck (loop indefinitely until cancelled), to complete more slowly than usual, or to throw an unexpected exception. This effect may support a denial of service attack. The issue is patched in version 1.14.2. There are a few available workarounds. Users may rate limit input parsing, limit the size of inputs based on system resources, and/or implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parse runtimes.","The mpatch_decode function in mpatch.c in Mercurial before 4.6.1 mishandles certain situations where there should be at least 12 bytes remaining after the current position in the patch data, but actually are not, aka OVE-20180430-0001.","The mpatch_apply function in mpatch.c in Mercurial before 4.6.1 incorrectly proceeds in cases where the fragment start is past the end of the original data, aka OVE-20180430-0004.","Mercurial prior to version 4.3 is vulnerable to a missing symlink check that can malicious repositories to modify files outside the repository","Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier allow untrusted applets and applications to gain privileges via vectors related to access to inner classes in the (1) JAX-WS and (2) JAXB packages.","Unspecified vulnerability in scripting language support in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update 6 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to gain privileges via an untrusted (1) application or (2) applet, as demonstrated by an application or applet that grants itself privileges to (a) read local files, (b) write to local files, or (c) execute local programs.","Unspecified vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier, and JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 16 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted RSA public key.","Unspecified vulnerability in Java Web Start in Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 4 and earlier allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files via an untrusted application, a different issue than CVE-2008-1190, aka \\\"The fifth issue.\\\"","A flaw was found in Mercurial before 4.9. It was possible to use symlinks and subrepositories to defeat Mercurial\\'s path-checking logic and write files outside a repository.","Unbounded memory allocation in Google Guava 11.0 through 24.x before 24.1.1 allows remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks against servers that depend on this library and deserialize attacker-provided data, because the AtomicDoubleArray class (when serialized with Java serialization) and the CompoundOrdering class (when serialized with GWT serialization) perform eager allocation without appropriate checks on what a client has sent and whether the data size is reasonable.","In Apache Commons IO before 2.7, When invoking the method FileNameUtils.normalize with an improper input string, like \\\"//../foo\\\", or \\\"\\\\..\\\\foo\\\", the result would be the same value, thus possibly providing access to files in the parent directory, but not further above (thus \\\"limited\\\" path traversal), if the calling code would use the result to construct a path value.","Apache HttpClient versions prior to version 4.5.13 and 5.0.3 can misinterpret malformed authority component in request URIs passed to the library as java.net.URI object
