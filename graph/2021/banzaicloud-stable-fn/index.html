An example payload is  `{ toString: !&lt;tag:yaml.org,2002:js/function&gt; \\'function (){return Date.now()}\\' } : 1`  which returns the object  {   \\\"1553107949161\\\": 1 }   ## Recommendation  Upgrade to version 3.13.1.","Affected versions of `ws` can crash when a specially crafted `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header containing `Object.prototype` property names as extension or parameter names is sent.  ## Proof of concept  ``` const WebSocket = require(\\'ws\\'); const net = require(\\'net\\');  const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 3000 }, function () {   const payload = \\'constructor\\';  // or \\',;constructor\\'    const request = [     \\'GET / HTTP/1.1\\',     \\'Connection: Upgrade\\',     \\'Sec-WebSocket-Key: test\\',     \\'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 8\\',     `Sec-WebSocket-Extensions: ${payload}`,     \\'Upgrade: websocket\\',     \\'\\r\\n\\'   ].join(\\'\\r\\n\\');    const socket = net.connect(3000, function () {     socket.resume();     socket.write(request);   }); }); ```   ## Recommendation  Update to version 3.3.1 or later.","Versions of `handlebars` prior to 3.0.8 or 4.5.2 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The package\\'s lookup helper fails to properly validate templates, allowing attackers to submit templates that execute arbitrary JavaScript in the system. It can be used to run arbitrary code in a server processing Handlebars templates or on a victim\\'s browser (effectively serving as Cross-Site Scripting).  The following template can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability:   ```{{#with \\\"constructor\\\"}} \t{{#with split as |a|}} \t\t{{pop (push \\\"alert(\\'Vulnerable Handlebars JS\\');\\\")}} \t\t{{#with (concat (lookup join (slice 0 1)))}} \t\t\t{{#each (slice 2 3)}} \t\t\t\t{{#with (apply 0 a)}} \t\t\t\t\t{{.}} \t\t\t\t{{/with}} \t\t\t{{/each}} \t\t{{/with}} \t{{/with}} {{/with}}```   ## Recommendation  Upgrade to version 3.0.8, 4.5.2 or later.","url-parse before 1.5.0 mishandles certain uses of backslash such as http:\\\\/ and interprets the URI as a relative path.","The package underscore from 1.13.0-0 and before 1.13.0-2, from 1.3.2 and before 1.12.1 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection via the template function, particularly when a variable property is passed as an argument as it is not sanitized.","The package printf before 0.6.1 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the regex string /\\\\%(?:\\\\(([\\\\w_.]+)\\\\)|([1-9]\\\\d*)\\\\$)?([0 +\\\\-\\\\]*)(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?(\\\\.)?(\\\\*|\\\\d+)?[hlL]?([\\\\%bscdeEfFgGioOuxX])/g in lib/printf.js. The vulnerable regular expression has cubic worst-case time complexity.","Lodash versions prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable to Command Injection via the template function.","Prototype pollution attack when using _.zipObjectDeep in lodash before 4.17.20.","This affects the package ini before 1.3.6. If an attacker submits a malicious INI file to an application that parses it with ini.parse, they will pollute the prototype on the application. This can be exploited further depending on the context.","Incorrect parsing in url-parse &lt;1.4.3 returns wrong hostname which leads to multiple vulnerabilities such as SSRF, Open Redirect, Bypass Authentication Protocol.","sshpk is vulnerable to ReDoS when parsing crafted invalid public keys.","A prototype pollution vulnerability was found in lodash &lt;4.17.11 where the functions merge, mergeWith, and defaultsDeep can be tricked into adding or modifying properties of Object.prototype.","A ReDoS (regular expression denial of service) flaw was found in the tough-cookie module before 2.3.3 for Node.js. An attacker that is able to make an HTTP request using a specially crafted cookie may cause the application to consume an excessive amount of CPU.","Minimatch is a minimal matching utility that works by converting glob expressions into JavaScript `RegExp` objects. The primary function, `minimatch(path, pattern)` in Minimatch 3.0.1 and earlier is vulnerable to ReDoS in the `pattern` parameter.","Insufficient validation and sanitization of user input exists in url-parse npm package version 1.4.4 and earlier may allow attacker to bypass security checks.","Lodash versions prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the toNumber, trim and trimEnd functions.","JSDom improperly allows the loading of local resources, which allows for local files to be manipulated by a malicious web page when script execution is
