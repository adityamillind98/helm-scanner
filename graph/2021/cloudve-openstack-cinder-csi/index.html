Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \\\"out\\\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \\\"outlen\\\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \\\"out\\\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).","There\\'s a flaw in lz4. An attacker who submits a crafted file to an application linked with lz4 may be able to trigger an integer overflow, leading to calling of memmove() on a negative size argument, causing an out-of-bounds write and/or a crash. The greatest impact of this flaw is to availability, with some potential impact to confidentiality and integrity as well.","A flaw was found in gnutls. A use after free issue in client_send_params in lib/ext/pre_shared_key.c may lead to memory corruption and other potential consequences.","A flaw was found in gnutls. A use after free issue in client sending key_share extension may lead to memory corruption and other consequences.","Double free in ICU in Google Chrome prior to 91.0.4472.77 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.","A flaw was found in Nettle in versions before 3.7.2, where several Nettle signature verification functions (GOST DSA, EDDSA &amp; ECDSA) result in the Elliptic Curve Cryptography point (ECC) multiply function being called with out-of-range scalers, possibly resulting in incorrect results. This flaw allows an attacker to force an invalid signature, causing an assertion failure or possible validation. The highest threat to this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.","stack_protect_prologue in cfgexpand.c and stack_protect_epilogue in function.c in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 4.1 through 8 (under certain circumstances) generate instruction sequences when targeting ARM targets that spill the address of the stack protector guard, which allows an attacker to bypass the protection of -fstack-protector, -fstack-protector-all, -fstack-protector-strong, and -fstack-protector-explicit against stack overflow by controlling what the stack canary is compared against.","A flaw was found in the way nettle\\'s RSA decryption functions handled specially crafted ciphertext. An attacker could use this flaw to provide a manipulated ciphertext leading to application crash and denial of service.","Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately. This, for example, affects use of ElGamal in OpenPGP.","An issue was discovered in p11-kit 0.23.6 through 0.23.21. A heap-based buffer overflow has been discovered in the RPC protocol used by p11-kit server/remote commands and the client library. When the remote entity supplies a serialized byte array in a CK_ATTRIBUTE, the receiving entity may not allocate sufficient length for the buffer to store the deserialized value.","An issue was discovered in p11-kit 0.21.1 through 0.23.21. Multiple integer overflows have been discovered in the array allocations in the p11-kit library and the p11-kit list command, where overflow checks are missing before calling realloc or calloc.","An issue was discovered in GnuTLS before 3.6.15. A server can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in a TLS 1.3 client if a no_renegotiation alert is sent with unexpected timing, and then an invalid second handshake occurs. The crash happens in the application\\'s error handling path, where the gnutls_deinit function is called after detecting a handshake failure.","ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL\\'s own \\\"d2i\\\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \\\"data\\\" and \\\"length\\\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \\\"data\\\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints proc","APT had several integer overflows and underflows while parsing .deb packages, aka GHSL-2020-168 GHSL-2020-169, in files apt-pkg/contrib/extracttar.cc, apt-pkg/deb/debfile.cc, and apt-pkg/contrib/arfile.cc. This issue affects: apt 1.2.32ubuntu0 versions prior to 1.2.32ubuntu0.2; 1.6.12ubuntu0 versions prior to 1.6.12ubuntu0.2; 2.0.2ubuntu0 versions prior to 2.0.2ubuntu0.2; 2.1.10ubuntu0 versions prior to 2.1.10ubuntu0.1;","basic/unit-name.c in systemd prior to 246.15, 247.8, 248.5, and 249.1 has a Memory Allocation with an Excessive Size Value (involving strdupa and alloca for a pathname controlled by a local attacker) that results in an operating system crash.","In the Zstandard command-line utility prior to v1.4.1, output files were created with default permissions. Correct file permissions (matching the input) would only be set at completion time. Output files could therefore be readable or writable to unintended parties.","International Components for Unicode (ICU-20850) v66.1 was discovered to contain a use after free bug in the pkg_createWithAssemblyCode function in the file tools/pkgdata/pkgdata.cpp.","An issue was discovered in p11-kit 0.21.1 through 0.23.21. A heap-based buffer over-read has been discovered in the RPC protocol used by thep11-kit server/remote commands and the client library. When the remote entity supplies a byte array through a serialized PKCS#11 function call, the receiving entity may allow the reading of up to 4 bytes of memory past the heap allocation.","The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) versions 2.32 and 2.33 has a use-after-free. It may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller, leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly unspecified other impact.","The wordexp function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.33 may crash or read arbitrary memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.","An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the \\'num\\' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the \\'num\\' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","LZ4 before 1.9.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in LZ4_write32 (related to LZ4_compress_destSize), affecting applications that call LZ4_compress_fast with a large input. (This issue can also lead to data corruption.) NOTE: the vendor states \\\"only a few specific / uncommon usages of the API are at risk.\\\"","It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can get new privileges through the execution of SUID binaries, which would allow to create binaries owned by the service transient group with the setgid bit set. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the GID will be recycled.","It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can create a SUID/SGID binary that would be allowed to run as the transient service UID/GID even after the service is terminated. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the UID/GID will be recycled.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a denial of service.","SQLite 3.30.1 mishandles certain SELECT statements with a nonexistent VIEW, leading to an application crash.","The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could optimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call, thus reducing the entropy of the random number generator. This occurred because a volatile operation was not specified. For example, within a single execution of a program, the output of every __builtin_darn() call may be the same.","A flaw was found in the way certificate signatures could be forged using collisions found in the SHA-1 algorithm. An attacker could use this weakness to create forged certificate signatures. This issue affects GnuPG versions before 2.2.18.","GNU libidn2 before 2.2.0 fails to perform the roundtrip checks specified in RFC3490 Section 4.2 when converting A-labels to U-labels. This makes it possible in some circumstances for one domain to impersonate another. By creating a malicious domain that matches a target domain except for the inclusion of certain punycoded Unicode characters (that would be discarded when converted first to a Unicode label and then back to an ASCII label), arbitrary domains can be impersonated.","A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version 2.14 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. This was fixed in version 2.32.","An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in glibc before 2.31 when handling signal trampolines on PowerPC. Specifically, the backtrace function did not properly check the array bounds when storing the frame address, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.","chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal\\'s input buffer.","It was discovered that there was a ECDSA timing attack in the libgcrypt20 cryptographic library. Version affected: 1.8.4-5, 1.7.6-2+deb9u3, and 1.6.3-2+deb8u4. Versions fixed: 1.8.5-2 and 1.6.3-2+deb8u7.","The ElGamal implementation in Libgcrypt before 1.9.4 allows plaintext recovery because, during interaction between two cryptographic libraries, a certain dangerous combination of the prime defined by the receiver\\'s public key, the generator defined by the receiver\\'s public key, and the sender\\'s ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration attack against OpenPGP.","The package python/cpython from 0 and before 3.6.13, from 3.7.0 and before 3.7.10, from 3.8.0 and before 3.8.8, from 3.9.0 and before 3.9.2 are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl and urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.","The iconv feature in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.32, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer over-read.","The iconv program in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.31 and earlier, when invoked with multiple suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.","There\\'s a flaw in Python 3\\'s pydoc. A local or adjacent attacker who discovers or is able to convince another local or adjacent user to start a pydoc server could access the server and use it to disclose sensitive information belonging to the other user that they would not normally be able to access. The highest risk of this flaw is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects Python versions before 3.8.9, Python versions before 3.9.3 and Python versions before 3.10.0a7.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.","SQLite before 3.32.0 allows a virtual table to be renamed to the name of one of its shadow tables, related to alter.c and build.c.","The GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.32 could overflow an on-stack buffer during range reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a 0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.","alter.c in SQLite through 3.30.1 allows attackers to trigger infinite recursion via certain types of self-referential views in conjunction with ALTER TABLE statements.","libpcre in PCRE before 8.44 allows an integer overflow via a large number after a ","SQLite 3.30.1 mishandles certain parser-tree rewriting, related to expr.c, vdbeaux.c, and window.c. This is caused by incorrect sqlite3WindowRewrite() error handling.","An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted.
