decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the \\\"out\\\" parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the \\\"outlen\\\" parameter is populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the \\\"out\\\" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).","In all versions of AppArmor mount rules are accidentally widened when compiled.","An out-of-bounds read was addressed with improved bounds checking. This issue is fixed in iOS 13.5 and iPadOS 13.5, macOS Catalina 10.15.5, tvOS 13.4.5, watchOS 6.2.5, iTunes 12.10.7 for Windows, iCloud for Windows 11.2, iCloud for Windows 7.19. A malicious application may cause a denial of service or potentially disclose memory contents.","GNU cpio through 2.13 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted pattern file, because of a dstring.c ds_fgetstr integer overflow that triggers an out-of-bounds heap write. NOTE: it is unclear whether there are common cases where the pattern file, associated with the -E option, is untrusted data.","ec_verify in kdc/kdc_preauth_ec.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.18.4 and 1.19.x before 1.19.2 allows remote attackers to cause a NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash. This occurs because a return value is not properly managed in a certain situation.","A user can tell curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 to require a successful upgrade to TLS when speaking to an IMAP, POP3 or FTP server (`--ssl-reqd` on the command line or`CURLOPT_USE_SSL` set to `CURLUSESSL_CONTROL` or `CURLUSESSL_ALL` withlibcurl). This requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly crafted but perfectly legitimate response.This flaw would then make curl silently continue its operations **withoutTLS** contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network.","Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to resource loops, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker creates multiple request streams and continually shuffles the priority of the streams in a way that causes substantial churn to the priority tree. This can consume excess CPU.","Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to window size manipulation and stream prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both.","ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL\\'s own \\\"d2i\\\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \\\"data\\\" and \\\"length\\\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \\\"data\\\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints proc","The \\\"origin\\\" parameter passed to some of the endpoints like \\'/trigger\\' was vulnerable to XSS exploit. This issue affects Apache Airflow versions &lt;1.10.15 in 1.x series and affects 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 and 2.x series. This is the same as CVE-2020-13944 &amp; CVE-2020-17515 but the implemented fix did not fix the issue completely. Update to Airflow 1.10.15 or 2.0.2. Please also update your Python version to the latest available PATCH releases of the installed MINOR versions, example update to Python 3.6.13 if you are on Python 3.6. (Those contain the fix for CVE-2021-23336 https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23336).","The ElGamal implementation in Libgcrypt before 1.9.4 allows plaintext recovery because, during interaction between two cryptographic libraries, a certain dangerous combination of the prime defined by the receiver\\'s public key, the generator defined by the receiver\\'s public key, and the sender\\'s ephemeral exponents can lead to a cross-configuration attack against OpenPGP.","When curl &gt;= 7.20.0 and &lt;= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server to retrieve data using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server can respond and send back multiple responses at once that curl caches. curl would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached responses but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got *before* the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this flaw, it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake responses, then pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate server and trick curl into sending data back to the user thinking the attacker\\'s injected data comes from the TLS-protected server.","Arm Armv8-A core implementations utilizing speculative execution past unconditional changes in control flow may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis, aka \\\"straight-line speculation.\\\"","A Reachable Assertion issue was discovered in the KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.17. If an attacker can obtain a krbtgt ticket using an older encryption type (single-DES, triple-DES, or RC4), the attacker can crash the KDC by making an S4U2Self request.","An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the \\'num\\' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the \\'num\\' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.","A use-after-free flaw was found in D-Bus Development branch &lt;= 1.13.16, dbus-1.12.x stable branch &lt;= 1.12.18, and dbus-1.10.x and older branches &lt;= 1.10.30 when a system has multiple usernames sharing the same UID. When a set of policy rules references these usernames, D-Bus may free some memory in the heap, which is still used by data structures necessary for the other usernames sharing the UID, possibly leading to a crash or other undefined behaviors","An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support \\\"saved UID\\\" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \\\"enable -f\\\" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.","It was found that system umask policy is not being honored when creating XDG user directories, since Xsession sources xdg-user-dirs.sh before setting umask policy. This only affects xdg-user-dirs before 0.15.5 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux.","Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately. This, for example, affects use of ElGamal in OpenPGP.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a denial of service.","This issue was addressed with improved checks. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.0.1, watchOS 7.0, iOS 14.0 and iPadOS 14.0, iCloud for Windows 7.21, tvOS 14.0. A remote attacker may be able to cause a denial of service.","libpcre in PCRE before 8.43 allows a subject buffer over-read in JIT when UTF is disabled, and \\\\X or \\\\R has more than one fixed quantifier, a related issue to CVE-2019-20454.","Interaction between the sks-keyserver code through 1.2.0 of the SKS keyserver network, and GnuPG through 2.2.16, makes it risky to have a GnuPG keyserver configuration line referring to a host on the SKS keyserver network. Retrieving data from this network may cause a persistent denial of service, because of a Certificate Spamming Attack.","In the client side of Heimdal before 7.6.0, failure to verify anonymous PKINIT PA-PKINIT-KX key exchange permits a man-in-the-middle attack. This issue is in krb5_init_creds_step in lib/krb5/init_creds_pw.c.","sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.","An information disclosure issue was addressed with improved state management. This issue is fixed in macOS Big Sur 11.0.1, watchOS 7.0, iOS 14.0 and iPadOS 14.0, iTunes for Windows 12.10.9, iCloud for Windows 11.5, tvOS 14.0. A remote attacker may be able to leak memory.","An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. The pre-defined function \\\"strlen\\\" is getting a \\\"NULL\\\" string as a parameter value in plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/ldap_principal2.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a modified kadmin client.","An issue has been found in libpng 1.6.34. It is a SEGV in the function png_free_data in png.c, related to the recommended error handling for png_read_image.","chroot in GNU coreutils, when used with --userspec, allows local users to escape to the parent session via a crafted TIOCSTI ioctl call, which pushes characters to the terminal\\'s input buffer.","The package python/cpython from 0 and before 3.6.13, from 3.7.0 and before 3.7.10, from 3.8.0 and before 3.8.8, from 3.9.0 and before 3.9.2 are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl and urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.","The client side in OpenSSH 5.7 through 8.4 has an Observable Discrepancy leading to an information leak in the algorithm negotiation. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to target initial connection attempts (where no host key for the server has been cached by the client). NOTE: some reports state that 8.5 and 8.6 are also affected.","The iconv feature in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.32, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer over-read.","There\\'s a flaw in Python 3\\'s pydoc. A local or adjacent attacker who discovers or is able to convince another local or adjacent user to start a pydoc server could access the server and use it to disclose sensitive information belonging to the other user that they would not normally be able to access. The highest risk of this flaw is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects Python versions before 3.8.9, Python versions before 3.9.3 and Python versions before 3.10.0a7.","A Bleichenbacher type side-channel based padding oracle attack was found in the way gnutls handles verification of RSA decrypted PKCS#1 v1.5 data. An attacker who is able to run process on the same physical core as the victim process, could use this to extract plaintext or in some cases downgrade any TLS connections to a vulnerable server.","The iconv function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.32 and earlier, when processing invalid multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390, and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.","An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted. This allows an attacker to remove themselves from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths if the administrator has used \\\"group blacklisting\\\" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths. This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.","In the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.28, the getaddrinfo function would successfully parse a string that contained an IPv4 address followed by whitespace and arbitrary characters, which could lead applications to incorrectly
