The function g_bytes_new has an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow could potentially lead to memory corruption.","BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND\\'s default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0 -&gt; 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -&gt; 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -&gt; 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition.

The vulnerability affects all currently maintained BIND 9 branches (9.11, 9.11-S, 9.16, 9.16-S, 9.17) as well as all other versions of BIND 9.","The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1","Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).","In BIND 9.10.0 -&gt; 9.11.21, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.16.5, 9.17.0 -&gt; 9.17.3, also affects 9.10.5-S1 -&gt; 9.11.21-S1 of the BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition, An attacker that can reach a vulnerable system with a specially crafted query packet can trigger a crash. To be vulnerable, the system must: * be running BIND that was built with \\\"--enable-native-pkcs11\\\" * be signing one or more zones with an RSA key * be able to receive queries from a possible attacker","sysdeps/i386/ldbl2mpn.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.23 on x86 targets has a stack-based buffer overflow if the input to any of the printf family of functions is an 80-bit long double with a non-canonical bit pattern, as seen when passing a \\\\x00\\\\x04\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x00\\\\x04 value to sprintf. NOTE: the issue does not affect glibc by default in 2016 or later (i.e., 2.23 or later) because of commits made in 2015 for inlining of C99 math functions through use of GCC built-ins. In other words, the reference to 2.23 is intentional despite the mention of \\\"Fixed for glibc 2.33\\\" in the 26649 reference.","A NULL pointer dereference was found in OpenLDAP server and was fixed in openldap 2.4.55, during a request for renaming RDNs. An unauthenticated attacker could remotely crash the slapd process by sending a specially crafted request, causing a Denial of Service.","A flaw was found in the way NSS handled CCS (ChangeCipherSpec) messages in TLS 1.3. This flaw allows a remote attacker to send multiple CCS messages, causing a denial of service for servers compiled with the NSS library. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability. This flaw affects NSS versions before 3.58.","In Lib/tarfile.py in Python through 3.8.3, an attacker is able to craft a TAR archive leading to an infinite loop when opened by tarfile.open, because _proc_pax lacks header validation.","In BIND 9.8.5 -&gt; 9.8.8, 9.9.3 -&gt; 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.9.3-S1 -&gt; 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -&gt; 9.16.13-S1 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -&gt; 9.17.11 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, when a vulnerable version of named receives a malformed IXFR triggering the flaw described above, the named process will terminate due to a failed assertion the next time the transferred secondary zone is refreshed.","In BIND 9.0.0 -&gt; 9.11.21, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.16.5, 9.17.0 -&gt; 9.17.3, also affects 9.9.3-S1 -&gt; 9.11.21-S1 of the BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition, An attacker on the network path for a TSIG-signed request, or operating the server receiving the TSIG-signed request, could send a truncated response to that request, triggering an assertion failure, causing the server to exit. Alternately, an off-path attacker would have to correctly guess when a TSIG-signed request was sent, along with other characteristics of the packet and message, and spoof a truncated response to trigger an assertion failure, causing the server to exit.","The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j.
