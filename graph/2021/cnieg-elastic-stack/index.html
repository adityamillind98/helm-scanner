The function g_bytes_new has an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow could potentially lead to memory corruption.","A malicious actor who intentionally exploits this lack of effective limitation on the number of fetches performed when processing referrals can, through the use of specially crafted referrals, cause a recursing server to issue a very large number of fetches in an attempt to process the referral. This has at least two potential effects: The performance of the recursing server can potentially be degraded by the additional work required to perform these fetches, and The attacker can exploit this behavior to use the recursing server as a reflector in a reflection attack with a high amplification factor.","BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a configuration which uses BIND\\'s default settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options. Although the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers. The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND 9.5.0 -&gt; 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -&gt; 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -&gt; 9.16.11-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition. Also release versions 9.17.0 -&gt; 9.17.1 of the BIND 9.17 development branch","jwt-go before 4.0.0-preview1 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations with []string{} for m[\\\"aud\\\"] (which is allowed by the specification). Because the type assertion fails, \\\"\\\" is the value of aud. This is a security problem if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.","In BIND 9.0.0 -&gt; 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -&gt; 9.16.13, and versions BIND 9.9.3-S1 -&gt; 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -&gt; 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -&gt; 9.17.11 of the BIND 9.17 development branch, when a vulnerable version of named receives a query for a record triggering the flaw described above, the named process will terminate due to a failed assertion check. The vulnerability affects all currently maintained BIND 9 branches (9.11, 9.11-S, 9.16, 9.16-S, 9.17) as well as all other versions of BIND 9.","Using a specially-crafted message, an attacker may potentially cause a BIND server to reach an inconsistent state if the attacker knows (or successfully guesses) the name of a TSIG key used by the server. Since BIND, by default, configures a local session key even on servers whose configuration does not otherwise make use of it, almost all current BIND servers are vulnerable. In releases of BIND dating from March 2018 and after, an assertion check in tsig.c detects this inconsistent state and deliberately exits. Prior to the introduction of the check the server would continue operating in an inconsistent state, with potentially harmful results.","An issue was discovered in dbus &gt;= 1.3.0 before 1.12.18. The DBusServer in libdbus, as used in dbus-daemon, leaks file descriptors when a message exceeds the per-message file descriptor limit. A local attacker with access to the D-Bus system bus or another system service\\'s private AF_UNIX socket could use this to make the system service reach its file descriptor limit, denying service to subsequent D-Bus clients.","The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not.

This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\\\\path`. If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\\\\extraction\\\\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths.

In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version 4.1.60.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. If a Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP/2 request, the field is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up. This is fine as long as the request is not proxied through as HTTP/1.1.

In a proxy case, users may assume the content-length is validated somehow, which is not the case. If the request is forwarded to a backend channel that is a HTTP/1.1 connection, the Content-Length now has meaning and needs to be checked. An attacker can smuggle requests inside the body as it gets downgraded from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1. For an example attack refer to the linked GitHub Advisory.

In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty\\'s multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user.

The fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected existing connections that had already been accepted from having their requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma` 4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue. This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as `nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client attacks (e.g. slowloris).
