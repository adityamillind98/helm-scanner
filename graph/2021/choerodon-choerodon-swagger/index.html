In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version 4.1.60.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. If a Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP/2 request, the field is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up. This is fine as long as the request is not proxied through as HTTP/1.1.

In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty\\'s multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user.

Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method \\\"File.createTempFile\\\" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions \\\"-rw-r--r--\\\".
