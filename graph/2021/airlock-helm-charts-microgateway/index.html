earlier and JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 15 and earlier, when local monitoring is enabled, allows remote attackers to \\\"perform unauthorized operations\\\" via unspecified vectors.","The Java XML Digital Signature implementation in Sun JDK and JRE 6 before Update 2 does not properly process XSLT stylesheets in XSLT transforms in XML signatures, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted stylesheet, a related issue to CVE-2007-3715.","Unspecified vulnerability in the JAX-WS client and service in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update 6 and earlier allows remote attackers to access URLs or cause a denial of service via unknown vectors involving \\\"processing of XML data\\\" by a trusted application.","Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier allow untrusted applets and applications to gain privileges via vectors related to access to inner classes in the (1) JAX-WS and (2) JAXB packages.","Unspecified vulnerability in scripting language support in Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update 6 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to gain privileges via an untrusted (1) application or (2) applet, as demonstrated by an application or applet that grants itself privileges to (a) read local files, (b) write to local files, or (c) execute local programs.","Unspecified vulnerability in Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier, and JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 16 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted RSA public key.","Unspecified vulnerability in Java Web Start in Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 4 and earlier allows remote attackers to create arbitrary files via an untrusted application, a different issue than CVE-2008-1190, aka \\\"The fifth issue.\\\"",null,"Calls to EVP_CipherUpdate, EVP_EncryptUpdate and EVP_DecryptUpdate may overflow the output length argument in some cases where the input length is close to the maximum permissable length for an integer on the platform. In such cases the return value from the function call will be 1 (indicating success), but the output length value will be negative. This could cause applications to behave incorrectly or crash. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).","The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue.
