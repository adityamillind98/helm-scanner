TiffDecode has a heap-based buffer overflow when decoding crafted YCbCr files because of certain interpretation conflicts with LibTIFF in RGBA mode. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-35654.","Node.js before 16.6.0, 14.17.4, and 12.22.4 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution, XSS, Application crashes due to missing input validation of host names returned by Domain Name Servers in Node.js dns library which can lead to output of wrong hostnames (leading to Domain Hijacking) and injection vulnerabilities in applications using the library.","libImaging/PcxDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has a PCX P mode buffer overflow.","libImaging/SgiRleDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has an SGI buffer overflow.","An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. There is an out-of-bounds read in J2kDecode, in j2ku_gray_i.","An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. There is an out-of-bounds read in J2kDecode, in j2ku_graya_la.","In the cryptography package before 3.3.2 for Python, certain sequences of update calls to symmetrically encrypt multi-GB values could result in an integer overflow and buffer overflow, as demonstrated by the Fernet class.","libImaging/TiffDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has a TIFF decoding integer overflow, related to realloc.","In Pillow before 8.1.0, TiffDecode has a heap-based buffer overflow when decoding crafted YCbCr files because of certain interpretation conflicts with LibTIFF in RGBA mode.","Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other exploits.","napi_get_value_string_*() allows various kinds of memory corruption in node &lt; 10.21.0, 12.18.0, and &lt; 14.4.0.","In libImaging/SgiRleDecode.c in Pillow through 7.0.0, a number of out-of-bounds reads exist in the parsing of SGI image files, a different issue than CVE-2020-5311.","Busybox contains a Missing SSL certificate validation vulnerability in The \\\"busybox wget\\\" applet that can result in arbitrary code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via Simply download any file over HTTPS using \\\"busybox wget https://compromised-domain.com/important-file\\\".","The implementation of realpath in libuv &lt; 10.22.1, &lt; 12.18.4, and &lt; 14.9.0 used within Node.js incorrectly determined the buffer size which can result in a buffer overflow if the resolved path is longer than 256 bytes.","In Pillow before 7.1.0, there are two Buffer Overflows in libImaging/TiffDecode.c.","An issue was discovered in urllib3 before 1.26.5. When provided with a URL containing many @ characters in the authority component, the authority regular expression exhibits catastrophic backtracking, causing a denial of service if a URL were passed as a parameter or redirected to via an HTTP redirect.","An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For EPS data, the readline implementation used in EPSImageFile has to deal with any combination of \\r and \\n as line endings. It used an accidentally quadratic method of accumulating lines while looking for a line ending. A malicious EPS file could use this to perform a DoS of Pillow in the open phase, before an image was accepted for opening.","An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For FLI data, FliDecode did not properly check that the block advance was non-zero, potentially leading to an infinite loop on load.","Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for an ICO container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large.","Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for an ICNS container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large.","Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large.","An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.1.1. There is an out-of-bounds read in SGIRleDecode.c.","An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.1.1. In TiffDecode.c, there is an out-of-bounds read in TiffreadRGBATile via invalid tile boundaries.","An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.1.1. In TiffDecode.c, there is a negative-offset memcpy with an invalid size.","The package pillow 5.2.0 and before 8.3.2 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the getrgb function.","Node.js before 16.6.1, 14.17.5, and 12.22.5 is vulnerable to a use after free attack where an attacker might be able to exploit the memory corruption, to change process behavior.","Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks as the whitelist includes \u201clocalhost6\u201d. When \u201clocalhost6\u201d is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim\\'s DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the \u201clocalhost6\u201d domain. As long as the attacker uses the \u201clocalhost6\u201d domain, they can still apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160.","Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an \\'unknownProtocol\\' are established. This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory.","httplib2 is a comprehensive HTTP client library for Python. In httplib2 before version 0.19.0, a malicious server which responds with long series of \\\"\\\\xa0\\\" characters in the \\\"www-authenticate\\\" header may cause Denial of Service (CPU burn while parsing header) of the httplib2 client accessing said server. This is fixed in version 0.19.0 which contains a new implementation of auth headers parsing using the pyparsing library.","There is a DoS vulnerability in Pillow before 6.2.2 caused by FpxImagePlugin.py calling the range function on an unvalidated 32-bit integer if the number of bands is large. On Windows running 32-bit Python, this results in an OverflowError or MemoryError due to the 2 GB limit. However, on Linux running 64-bit Python this results in the process being terminated by the OOM killer.","Node.js &lt; 12.18.4 and &lt; 14.11 can be exploited to perform HTTP desync attacks and deliver malicious payloads to unsuspecting users. The payloads can be crafted by an attacker to hijack user sessions, poison cookies, perform clickjacking, and a multitude of other attacks depending on the architecture of the underlying system. The attack was possible due to a bug in processing of carrier-return symbols in the HTTP header names.","TLS session reuse can lead to host certificate verification bypass in node version &lt; 12.18.0 and &lt; 14.4.0.","libImaging/FliDecode.c in Pillow before 6.2.2 has an FLI buffer overflow.","In Pillow before 8.1.0, PcxDecode has a buffer over-read when decoding a crafted PCX file because the user-supplied stride value is trusted for buffer calculations.","An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.1.1. The PDF parser allows a regular expression DoS (ReDoS) attack via a crafted PDF file because of a catastrophic backtracking regex.","Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 allow two copies of a header field in an HTTP request (for example, two Transfer-Encoding header fields). In this case, Node.js identifies the first header field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling.","An XSS vulnerability was discovered in python-lxml\\'s clean module versions before 4.6.3. When disabling the safe_attrs_only and forms arguments, the Cleaner class does not remove the formaction attribute allowing for JS to bypass the sanitizer. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run arbitrary JS code on users who interact with incorrectly sanitized HTML. This issue is patched in lxml 4.6.3.","A XSS vulnerability was discovered in python-lxml\\'s clean module. The module\\'s parser didn\\'t properly imitate browsers, which caused different behaviors between the sanitizer and the user\\'s page. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run arbitrary HTML/JS code.","An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For BLP data, BlpImagePlugin did not properly check that reads (after jumping to file offsets) returned data. This could lead to a DoS where the decoder could be run a large number of times on empty data.","An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. PSDImagePlugin.PsdImageFile lacked a sanity check on the number of input layers relative to the size of the data block. This could lead to a DoS on Image.open prior to Image.load.","In libImaging/Jpeg2KDecode.c in Pillow before 7.1.0, there are multiple out-of-bounds reads via a crafted JP2 file.","In libImaging/PcxDecode.c in Pillow before 7.1.0, an out-of-bounds read can occur when reading PCX files where state-&gt;shuffle is instructed to read beyond state-&gt;buffer.","Pillow before 7.1.0 has multiple out-of-bounds reads in libImaging/FliDecode.c.","In Pillow before 8.1.0, SGIRleDecode has a 4-byte buffer over-read when decoding crafted SGI RLE image files because offsets and length tables are mishandled.","If the Node.js https API was used incorrectly and \\\"undefined\\\" was in passed for the \\\"rejectUnauthorized\\\" parameter, no error was returned and connections to servers with an expired certificate would have been accepted.","Node.js before 16.4.1, 14.17.2, 12.22.2 is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read when uv__idna_toascii() is used to convert strings to ASCII.
