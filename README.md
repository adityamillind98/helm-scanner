# IaC Security Scanner for ArtifactHub

## Status: Early PoC/Alpha
So far, this code has been used to generate a dataset for investigation into the current state of Helm security posture.

It needs plenty of work and we have a roadmap planned, in our [issues backlog, here](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/helm-scanner/milestones)

You can find the written based on the data generated here, once the articles are live.

## What is it?
This is a work-in-progress codebase designed to automate discovering, templating, security scanning, then recording and providing easy access to the results for publically available Helm charts.

We're currently using our static analysis tool [Checkov.io](https://checkov.io) for the security scan.

Currently, the scanner enumerates all Helm charts from repositories listed as containing HELM in [https://artifacthub.io](https://artifacthub.io), for each repo, we collect all available charts, download the latest version of each and scans them with the Checkov.

Checkov already handles templating out the Helm3 charts, based on default `values.yml` and running te resultant Kubernetes manifests through our kubernetes checks.

## I just want to scan my own HELM Charts or Kubernetes manifests
Then you can use checkov.io directly if you're not looking to collect ans analyse data across thousands of public charts.

Simply:
```
pip install checkov
checkov -d <path to Chart directories or K8S yaml>

```
For more info on Checkov, see [Checkov.io](https://checkov.io)

## Output format
The dataset is outputted as a number of CSV's, by default in a local dir `./results`.
For each repository found in [https://artifacthub.io](https://artifacthub.io), we output three CSV's:

- *checks-reponame.csv*: List of all checks, passed and failed for each chart within the repo, including chart metadata.
- *summarytable-reponame.csv*: Summary of passed and failed checks per Chart from the given repo.
- *deps-table-reponame.csv*: Listing of all the Helm chart dependancies per Chart, and wether they were resolved prior to scanning (`helm deps` output metadata).

The CSV's are formatted in this way to make upload to Amazon S3 and then consumption by AWS Quicksight simple. However, we do plan to expose this data in a more consumable way, via API's and/or integrating with existing security dashboards, as easily sharing or providing public access to quicksight data is not possible. See [issues backlog, here](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/helm-scanner/milestones)

## Running
You'll need an artifacthub API token and secret token pair, provided as environment variables, then `main.py` can just be run, for example:

```
pipenv shell
ARTIFACTHUB_TOKEN=token ARTIFACTHUB_TOKEN_SECRET=secret python main.py
```
